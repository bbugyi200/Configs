Hey Josh,

I want to make it clear though that this decision to leave is final and I am not open to
negotiating against the offer I have received.

My last day of work (provided that Edgestream permits me to stay this long) will be on
2020-01-15 (a Friday). 

===== TODO =====
* Write report on projects that you are lead on.
* Compliment Josh.

===== Report =====
Cleanup Issues/MRs
