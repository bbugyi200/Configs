The packages listed in .txt files in this directory are not necessarily
installed (i.e. listing a package in one of these files does not trigger
installation).  If they are installed for some other reason, however, these
packages will obey the constraints listed in this file. See pip's [official
docs][constraints-doc] for more information.
