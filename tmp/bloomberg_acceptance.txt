Hey Alex,

Frankly, I'm just relieved to be done with negotiations. Not my strong suite at all :).
Thanks for asking for me anyway. Really, a "fair offer" is all I was looking for; the
absolute values were of less importance. Furthermore, I've continued my research since Sunday
and I did find that teamblind.com seems to indicate slightly lower numbers than levels.fyi,
so maybe I was aiming a little bit high.

Anyway, if the offer is still valid, I'm more than ready to accept! I'm really excited to be
joining the team and look forward to moving forward with the onboarding process!

START DATE: I need to give at least two weeks notice, but would prefer to give one month if
that is possible. This would give me enough time to wrap up the projects I'm currently
working on and transition a few projects that I am currently the lead on to other members of
the team.

Do you need anything else from me before you can send me a written offer?
