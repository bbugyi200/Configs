# These are my main configuration files. 

I keep my configuration files on Dropbox and then just either create a symbolic link to each folder/file from my home directory or 'source' the file into my local config (useful if you need to also apply local-only configs to a machine).

What's the point? Well, when I need to make a change to one of my configuration files, I only need to edit it once and then all of my devices will see the change. This also makes setting up the dev environment on a new machine a walk in the park.
