2018-03-04 00:44:19	monochrom	So I think Hutton's book is similar to how I would teach Haskell. Creating and predicting programs as (and by) matter-of-fact algebra and cold hard logic. Unfortunately this means I'm the only one who like it. There is an economical reason those who choose to be programmers hate this.

2018-03-04 01:18:09	qeyoa	the book author says that the second definition of `occurs` in here: http://lpaste.net/363102 is more efficient than the first one, since it only requires one comparison. But i don't understand how, the `compare` function definition still has `if elseif else` inside it, where is the difference?

2018-03-04 01:20:05	EvanR	whether x < y or compare x y is more efficient depends on the Ord implementation right ?
2018-03-04 01:20:49	qeyoa	how?
2018-03-04 01:21:27	EvanR	you are free to implement only half of Ord, the rest being defined by default

2018-03-04 01:22:28	EvanR	"Minimal complete definition: either compare or <=. Using compare can be more efficient for complex types."

2018-03-04 01:23:00	EvanR	occurs1 uses == and <
2018-03-04 01:23:00	Lears	I think the authors point is that in the second case compare x y is computed exactly once, but in the first case it may need to be computed once for x == y, once again for x < y if x /= y, and once again if x > y.
2018-03-04 01:23:07	EvanR	occurs2 uses only compare

2018-03-04 09:42:06	alanz	because hie master has a makefile that installs the three different exes, you just need to get your client to choose appropriately. This can be done in vscode by selecting to use the wrapper, or in emacs with a defcustom thing
