2018-03-06 20:29:07	terminalator	I'm tinkering with the config. I'd like to configure a custom key binding that shows hints and download and then downloads a file to a particular directory. How does one achieve this?
2018-03-06 20:38:37	daniel_j	';d' keybind does that by default it sounds like
2018-03-06 20:39:55	jgkamat	indeed :)
2018-03-06 20:40:10	jgkamat	:hints links download
2018-03-06 20:41:00	daniel_j	:bind by itself gives you a nice listing of all the bound commands, nice to use as a reference too
2018-03-06 20:45:12	jakanaka-evangel	If you want to download to a particular directory, you have to use :bind links run download --dest ~/mydir {hint-url}
2018-03-06 20:45:39	jakanaka-evangel	Using only :bind links download doesn't support the --dest option at the moment, i think
2018-03-06 20:45:50	jgkamat	you might be able to set download.location.directory as well (but I'm not sure)
2018-03-06 20:46:23	jakanaka-evangel	:hint*
2018-03-06 20:47:24	terminalator	Thanks for pointing me in the right direction
2018-03-06 20:48:12	terminalator	I've specified ~/Downloads downloads.location.directory
2018-03-06 20:48:46	jgkamat	I think that ~/Downloads is the default (it is for me at least) :P
2018-03-06 20:48:50	terminalator	But I'd like to download specfic file formats like .pdf to ~/Documents
2018-03-06 20:49:25	terminalator	So I'm trying to set up this key binding that allows me to temporarily download to another location
2018-03-06 20:49:31	jgkamat	hmm, I think that would be possible with a userscript (you can get the link, filter it as needed, and call :download or whatever you want with args)
2018-03-06 20:49:39	jgkamat	I'm not sure a non-userscript way though
2018-03-06 20:50:59	terminalator	This dude seems to have it configured
2018-03-06 20:51:01	terminalator	https://youtube.com/watch?v=g2RtjO_jXvY
2018-03-06 20:51:16	terminalator	But his method is outdated I guess
2018-03-06 20:52:20	jakanaka-evangel	You can bind different keys to download to different directories
2018-03-06 20:52:29	jgkamat	ooh, that's a good solution too :D
2018-03-06 20:53:04	jakanaka-evangel	for example :bind ;p hint links run download --dest ~/Documets {hint-url}
2018-03-06 20:53:23	terminalator	By the way, the config is supposed to be .py format, right?
2018-03-06 20:53:34	jgkamat	if you wanted to change the binding temporarily, you could just bind :set -t to a key, and then use :later to set it back to the original one later on
2018-03-06 20:53:34	terminalator	jakanaka-evangel: I'll give that a try
2018-03-06 20:53:51	jgkamat	terminalator: there's two config options, a python advanced config, and a built-in one that works with :set and :bind
2018-03-06 20:54:41	terminalator	jgkamat: Oh, really. I see.
2018-03-06 21:29:57	⚡	ots is now known as oats
2018-03-06 21:36:05	daniel_j	does qute do funky things with a virtual cursor at all, particularly for clicking on items? i keep my cursor out of the way in the corner, but after clicking on an item (say a 4chan image) the site thinks my mouse is there permanently and gives previews on items in that location etc
2018-03-06 21:36:25	daniel_j	by clicking i mean via a hint
2018-03-06 21:37:59	daniel_j	it may eeven just be 4chan, i haven't noticed it elsewhere
2018-03-06 21:42:54	daniel_j	it is elsewhere. not an issue just interesting

2018-03-06 22:11:37	jgkamat	but I think it shouldn't be an issue unless you use ;h :/
2018-03-06 22:13:01	daniel_j	yeah just read that, it is
2018-03-06 22:13:14	daniel_j	might be mentioning it on the issue
2018-03-06 22:13:20	daniel_j	shall do
2018-03-06 22:13:33	daniel_j	might be worth*
2018-03-06 22:20:36	daniel_j	interested if webkit vs webengine influences the behavior. not sure if it's logical or not (using webkit, don't have webengine avialable to test with)
2018-03-06 22:22:57	jgkamat	it is possible that there's different behavior on either, I think the issue was referencing webengine though, so the issue might be worse on webkit (haven't tried)

2018-03-07 16:37:26	jgkamat	Yay :D
2018-03-07 16:38:42	⚡	Guest6886 is now known as Haudegen
2018-03-07 17:50:07	The-Compiler	and with a quick new input.insert_mode.auto_enter setting, v1.2.0 should be ready for conkeror-refugees :)
2018-03-07 19:06:22	fiete	thanks for the screenshot jgkamat
2018-03-07 19:30:23	egan	I've noticed in the past few months that qutebrowser really thrashes my disk. When a load a website, the UI will freeze while qutebrowser writes 400K/s to the disk for seconds at a time. On some sites, every time I scroll, it writes to the disk. Does anyone know what is causing this?
2018-03-07 22:05:59	terminalator	How does one disable restore of tabs in the config.py?
2018-03-07 22:09:53	toofar	auto_save.session I guess
2018-03-07 22:10:42	jgkamat	egan: this is on load complete right?
2018-03-07 22:12:16	jgkamat	egan: there was a big improvement by turning on WAL mode, which should be in the next release https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/3509
2018-03-07 22:13:32	terminalator	Hmmm, strange I've already set that one to 'False' and after rebooting my machine and executing qutebrowser it still restore previous tabs
2018-03-07 22:14:54	jgkamat	huh, that's rather interesting, I'm definitely not seeing that with that setting on false :/
2018-03-07 22:22:32	aiel[m]	jgkamat: beauty is in the eye of the beholder
2018-03-07 22:23:23	jgkamat	lolol, I think you can update the screenshot if you make a better one ;). I just wanted something besides "no picture" tbh :P
2018-03-07 22:54:37	toofar	terminalator: are you setting it via :set but not including autoconfig.yml in your config.py?
2018-03-07 23:05:50	Evidlo	is there a way to tell tox to build with qt 5.10?
2018-03-07 23:10:30	jgkamat	Evidlo: from pypi? I think the dependencies are set up to pull PyQt 5.10.1 from pypi
2018-03-07 23:27:41	Evidlo	jgkamat: I'm building from git
2018-03-07 23:28:39	jgkamat	hmm, if you're building from pypi, it should be giving you 5.10 then. Maybe I don't know some tox edge case though
2018-03-08 00:09:41	quanta	Can i change the scroll speed?
2018-03-08 00:10:09	jgkamat	quanta: are you using the default scrolling? You can try :scroll-page or :scroll-px over :scroll to fine tune your scrolling behavior to page fractions or pixels
2018-03-08 00:10:27	jgkamat	:scroll just presses <down> or <up>, which you can run in with a count, but it's a bit hacky
2018-03-08 00:12:16	quanta	Yup, using the regular mouse wheel scroll. I suppose the :scroll-page and :scroll-px doesnt support acceleration, or does it?
2018-03-08 00:13:33	jgkamat	I don't exactly understand what you mean by "acceleration" :P. https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/issues/591 (maybe) for configuring scrolling behavior, although I don't know how possible that is.
2018-03-08 00:24:40	quanta	I'm on i laptop and using trackpad. That's why i would like to keep the mouse acceleration, where the scrolling is faster and faster the "longer" or "more" you scoll in a scrolling session if you get what i mean
2018-03-08 00:25:47	jgkamat	ah, hmm. I'm not exactly sure how trackpads even work, but I think that's handled either by the trackpad driver or by webengine. I think you want to change settings in synaptics
2018-03-08 00:28:20	dive	synclient is your friend.
2018-03-08 00:33:08	quanta	hmm. does synclient support including a spicific scroll setting in a specific application?
2018-03-08 00:33:50	dive	Not by application, no.
