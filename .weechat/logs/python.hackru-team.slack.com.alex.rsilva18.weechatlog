2018-02-22 13:36:49	alex.rsilva18	Hey Brian, I'm so sorry I haven't been able to help out, I really want to get to it but I'm taking all CS classes and I'm always stranded with a lot of work that doesn't allow me to get to it... I'm really sorry about that and I don't know if you prefer just going on without me or me keep updating you with my availability. Just let me know and I'm sorry for the inconvenience 
2018-02-22 15:22:59	bryan.bugyi	Hey Alex. Don't worry about it. That's the beauty of Waffle (our project is here: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU). If you've got some free time to work on this with us, just pick an Issue, assign it to yourself, and put it into the "In Progress" queue. And if you can't find the time, no worries. No harm done because no one is waiting on you to finish anything unless one of the issues is "In Progress" under your name. Also, feel free to create your own Issues if you've got a new idea or if you find a bug somewhere that you want to fix.
