We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

2017-09-16 13:56:00		For those who don't know, we implemented a question into our application this year for hackers to fill out and we're accepting/denying based on the quality/effort put into their answer to the question. To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

2017-09-16 13:56:00		For those who don't know, we implemented a question into our application this year for hackers to fill out and we're accepting/denying based on the quality/effort put into their answer to the question. To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.

2017-09-16 13:56:00		For those who don't know, we implemented a question into our application this year for hackers to fill out and we're accepting/denying based on the quality/effort put into their answer to the question. To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

2017-09-16 13:56:00		For those who don't know, we implemented a question into our application this year for hackers to fill out and we're accepting/denying based on the quality/effort put into their answer to the question. To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.

To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

2017-10-07 16:20:03	heman-gandhi	It's also the last semester's links and info. That'll be updated soon.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

2017-09-16 13:56:00		For those who don't know, we implemented a question into our application this year for hackers to fill out and we're accepting/denying based on the quality/effort put into their answer to the question. To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd.

2017-09-16 13:56:00		For those who don't know, we implemented a question into our application this year for hackers to fill out and we're accepting/denying based on the quality/effort put into their answer to the question. To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

2017-09-16 13:56:00		For those who don't know, we implemented a question into our application this year for hackers to fill out and we're accepting/denying based on the quality/effort put into their answer to the question. To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd.

2017-09-16 13:56:00		For those who don't know, we implemented a question into our application this year for hackers to fill out and we're accepting/denying based on the quality/effort put into their answer to the question. To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

We will be unloading 2 UHauls full of food as soon as they arrive and bringing them into a kitchen on the lower level, Floor G2, using trolleys that the student center will let us borrow. I estimate this could take up to 2-3 hours.

2017-09-16 13:56:00		For those who don't know, we implemented a question into our application this year for hackers to fill out and we're accepting/denying based on the quality/effort put into their answer to the question. To accept/deny people, everyone needs to be registered for HackRU and made an admin. We are asking all directors & organizers to accept/deny at least 20 people by Friday, Sept 22nd. Comment on this if you have any questions :slightly_smiling_face: We will be posting about acceptance examples later.
