2017-09-16 14:37:00	adshastri	hi team - for this semester, are we including sponsor mentors in the slackbot or doing a channel per company like last semester?

2017-09-16 14:40:30	srihari.shankar1	Yes bother Sam about it 
2017-09-16 15:51:46	azoam	Anyone who signs up to be a mentor on the sing up form is a mentor 
2017-09-16 15:51:58	azoam	so sponsors that want to be mentors just have to sign up to be a mentor on the form day of 
2017-09-16 15:52:05	azoam	and it should bother them when a hacker needs help 
2017-09-16 16:04:08	adshastri	okay so are we not doing the channel per sponsor then? or are we doing that too 
2017-09-16 16:22:43	srihari.shankar1	We could do both idk really

2017-12-06 01:10:52	bryan.bugyi	@atharva.kench @skeyupower Just a heads up. I changed the branch name from `add-mentors` to `develop` [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys 
2018-02-02 17:21:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Who do we need to reach out to for AWS credentials again? 
2018-02-02 17:48:05	alex.rsilva18	Sri deployed it on aws last time I remember so he should have access to it 
2018-02-02 22:02:29	srihari.shankar1	Pm me or heman  
2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-11 05:59:56	bryan.bugyi	One more thing that's less important. I found this tool that lets you edit/view GitHub Issues from the command-line. It's awesome, so I thought I'd share: https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi.

2018-02-21 20:46:32	heman-gandhi	Hi guys! I just wanted to confirm if you all were ready to deploy for HackHERS this weekend. If so, how does the bot function? Does it text like it used to last semester? 
2018-02-21 21:16:11	heman-gandhi	@bryan.bugyi ^ 
2018-02-21 21:54:34	bryan.bugyi	Is it ready?
2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think it should be. I would really like to do a live testing with at least 3 people (myself included) at tomorrow's meeting just to make sure everything works the way it should._

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think the best way to setup the mentor database would be to have each mentor use the `@<BOTID> register` command. Here's the output of the `@<BOTID> help register` command (this doesn't display unless explicitly requested so hackers can't see it):_

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 21:16:11	heman-gandhi	@bryan.bugyi ^ 
2018-02-21 21:54:34	bryan.bugyi	Is it ready?
2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think it should be. I would really like to do a live testing with at least 3 people (myself included) at tomorrow's meeting just to make sure everything works the way it should._

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.

2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys 
2018-02-02 17:21:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Who do we need to reach out to for AWS credentials again? 
2018-02-02 17:48:05	alex.rsilva18	Sri deployed it on aws last time I remember so he should have access to it 
2018-02-02 22:02:29	srihari.shankar1	Pm me or heman  
2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-11 05:59:56	bryan.bugyi	One more thing that's less important. I found this tool that lets you edit/view GitHub Issues from the command-line. It's awesome, so I thought I'd share: https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi.

2018-02-21 20:46:32	heman-gandhi	Hi guys! I just wanted to confirm if you all were ready to deploy for HackHERS this weekend. If so, how does the bot function? Does it text like it used to last semester? 
2018-02-21 21:16:11	heman-gandhi	@bryan.bugyi ^ 
2018-02-21 21:54:34	bryan.bugyi	Is it ready?
2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think it should be. I would really like to do a live testing with at least 3 people (myself included) at tomorrow's meeting just to make sure everything works the way it should._

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-10-14 00:46:43	rz187	When were you planning to tell me this? You're telling me I prioritized this, that you will not even use for six months, over my essay that's due Monday, for nothing 
2017-10-14 00:47:15	srihari.shankar1	Is the idea bot tested 
2017-10-14 00:47:20	rz187	Yes. 
2017-10-14 00:47:27	rz187	Why the hell would i submit something I didn't test. 
2017-10-14 00:47:33	srihari.shankar1	Cause it it is I’ll deploy it 
2017-10-14 00:47:43	srihari.shankar1	But I’ll need help  
2017-10-14 00:47:51	rz187	When does the thing start 
2017-10-14 00:48:00	srihari.shankar1	You made a seperate bot right  
2017-10-14 00:48:04	rz187	Yes. 
2017-10-14 00:48:25	srihari.shankar1	Be there at 7am tomorrow  
2017-10-14 00:48:34	srihari.shankar1	At rsc  
2017-10-14 00:48:39	rz187	When does it start 
2017-10-14 00:48:47	srihari.shankar1	Doors open at 10 
2017-10-14 00:49:18	rz187	I'll be there as early as i can...maybe not 7\ 
2017-10-14 00:49:27	srihari.shankar1	Ok that’s fine 
2017-10-14 00:50:21	rz187	Next time, please communicate to the rest of the team changes in deadlines and how to get things up and running...because we started later than we would have hoped. 
2017-10-14 00:50:30	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys, I'm driving up but I'll try to be there at like 8 so I can help you guys out with anything you need [:parrot:2] 
2017-10-14 00:54:41	srihari.shankar1	@rz187 for spring things should be better cause we have more time

2017-12-06 01:10:52	bryan.bugyi	@atharva.kench @skeyupower Just a heads up. I changed the branch name from `add-mentors` to `develop` [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys 
2018-02-02 17:21:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Who do we need to reach out to for AWS credentials again? 
2018-02-02 17:48:05	alex.rsilva18	Sri deployed it on aws last time I remember so he should have access to it

2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-10-14 00:44:55	rz187	so what changes would the slack bot have over last semester's? 
2017-10-14 00:46:28	srihari.shankar1	Mainly twilio stuff  
2017-10-14 00:46:43	rz187	When were you planning to tell me this? You're telling me I prioritized this, that you will not even use for six months, over my essay that's due Monday, for nothing

2017-12-06 01:10:52	bryan.bugyi	@atharva.kench @skeyupower Just a heads up. I changed the branch name from `add-mentors` to `develop` [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-12-06 01:10:52	bryan.bugyi	@atharva.kench @skeyupower Just a heads up. I changed the branch name from `add-mentors` to `develop` [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02		
2018-01-25 22:39:02		SLACK_API_KEY=xoxb-278958238756-4h4KYWlUOq0tJurbDZ4yfHWI 
2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys 
2018-02-02 17:21:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Who do we need to reach out to for AWS credentials again? 
2018-02-02 17:48:05	alex.rsilva18	Sri deployed it on aws last time I remember so he should have access to it

2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-11 05:59:56	bryan.bugyi	One more thing that's less important. I found this tool that lets you edit/view GitHub Issues from the command-line. It's awesome, so I thought I'd share: https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi.

2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification

2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)

2018-02-02 22:02:29	srihari.shankar1	Pm me or heman  
2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-11 05:59:56	bryan.bugyi	One more thing that's less important. I found this tool that lets you edit/view GitHub Issues from the command-line. It's awesome, so I thought I'd share: https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi.

2018-02-21 20:46:32	heman-gandhi	Hi guys! I just wanted to confirm if you all were ready to deploy for HackHERS this weekend. If so, how does the bot function? Does it text like it used to last semester?

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.

2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-10-14 00:48:47	srihari.shankar1	Doors open at 10 
2017-10-14 00:49:18	rz187	I'll be there as early as i can...maybe not 7\ 
2017-10-14 00:49:27	srihari.shankar1	Ok that’s fine 
2017-10-14 00:50:21	rz187	Next time, please communicate to the rest of the team changes in deadlines and how to get things up and running...because we started later than we would have hoped. 
2017-10-14 00:50:30	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys, I'm driving up but I'll try to be there at like 8 so I can help you guys out with anything you need [:parrot:2]

2017-12-06 01:10:52	bryan.bugyi	@atharva.kench @skeyupower Just a heads up. I changed the branch name from `add-mentors` to `develop` [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02		
2018-01-25 22:39:02		SLACK_API_KEY=xoxb-278958238756-4h4KYWlUOq0tJurbDZ4yfHWI 
2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys

2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-11 05:59:56	bryan.bugyi	One more thing that's less important. I found this tool that lets you edit/view GitHub Issues from the command-line. It's awesome, so I thought I'd share: https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification

2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-12-06 01:10:52	bryan.bugyi	@atharva.kench @skeyupower Just a heads up. I changed the branch name from `add-mentors` to `develop` [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification

2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.

2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-09-16 15:51:46	azoam	Anyone who signs up to be a mentor on the sing up form is a mentor 
2017-09-16 15:51:58	azoam	so sponsors that want to be mentors just have to sign up to be a mentor on the form day of 
2017-09-16 15:52:05	azoam	and it should bother them when a hacker needs help 
2017-09-16 16:04:08	adshastri	okay so are we not doing the channel per sponsor then? or are we doing that too

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys 
2018-02-02 17:21:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Who do we need to reach out to for AWS credentials again? 
2018-02-02 17:48:05	alex.rsilva18	Sri deployed it on aws last time I remember so he should have access to it

2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification

2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.

2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 20:46:32	heman-gandhi	Hi guys! I just wanted to confirm if you all were ready to deploy for HackHERS this weekend. If so, how does the bot function? Does it text like it used to last semester?

2018-02-21 21:54:34	bryan.bugyi	Is it ready?
2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think it should be. I would really like to do a live testing with at least 3 people (myself included) at tomorrow's meeting just to make sure everything works the way it should._

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-10-14 00:46:28	srihari.shankar1	Mainly twilio stuff  
2017-10-14 00:46:43	rz187	When were you planning to tell me this? You're telling me I prioritized this, that you will not even use for six months, over my essay that's due Monday, for nothing

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02		
2018-01-25 22:39:02		SLACK_API_KEY=xoxb-278958238756-4h4KYWlUOq0tJurbDZ4yfHWI 
2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys 
2018-02-02 17:21:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Who do we need to reach out to for AWS credentials again? 
2018-02-02 17:48:05	alex.rsilva18	Sri deployed it on aws last time I remember so he should have access to it

2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-11 05:59:56	bryan.bugyi	One more thing that's less important. I found this tool that lets you edit/view GitHub Issues from the command-line. It's awesome, so I thought I'd share: https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi.

2018-02-21 21:54:34	bryan.bugyi	Is it ready?
2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think it should be. I would really like to do a live testing with at least 3 people (myself included) at tomorrow's meeting just to make sure everything works the way it should._

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-12-06 01:10:52	bryan.bugyi	@atharva.kench @skeyupower Just a heads up. I changed the branch name from `add-mentors` to `develop` [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-09-16 14:37:00	adshastri	hi team - for this semester, are we including sponsor mentors in the slackbot or doing a channel per company like last semester?

2017-09-16 14:40:30	srihari.shankar1	Yes bother Sam about it 
2017-09-16 15:51:46	azoam	Anyone who signs up to be a mentor on the sing up form is a mentor 
2017-09-16 15:51:58	azoam	so sponsors that want to be mentors just have to sign up to be a mentor on the form day of 
2017-09-16 15:52:05	azoam	and it should bother them when a hacker needs help 
2017-09-16 16:04:08	adshastri	okay so are we not doing the channel per sponsor then? or are we doing that too 
2017-09-16 16:22:43	srihari.shankar1	We could do both idk really

2017-12-06 01:10:52	bryan.bugyi	@atharva.kench @skeyupower Just a heads up. I changed the branch name from `add-mentors` to `develop` [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys 
2018-02-02 17:21:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Who do we need to reach out to for AWS credentials again? 
2018-02-02 17:48:05	alex.rsilva18	Sri deployed it on aws last time I remember so he should have access to it 
2018-02-02 22:02:29	srihari.shankar1	Pm me or heman  
2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-11 05:59:56	bryan.bugyi	One more thing that's less important. I found this tool that lets you edit/view GitHub Issues from the command-line. It's awesome, so I thought I'd share: https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi.

2018-02-21 20:46:32	heman-gandhi	Hi guys! I just wanted to confirm if you all were ready to deploy for HackHERS this weekend. If so, how does the bot function? Does it text like it used to last semester? 
2018-02-21 21:16:11	heman-gandhi	@bryan.bugyi ^ 
2018-02-21 21:54:34	bryan.bugyi	Is it ready?
2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think it should be. I would really like to do a live testing with at least 3 people (myself included) at tomorrow's meeting just to make sure everything works the way it should._

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think the best way to setup the mentor database would be to have each mentor use the `@<BOTID> register` command. Here's the output of the `@<BOTID> help register` command (this doesn't display unless explicitly requested so hackers can't see it):_

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 21:16:11	heman-gandhi	@bryan.bugyi ^ 
2018-02-21 21:54:34	bryan.bugyi	Is it ready?
2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think it should be. I would really like to do a live testing with at least 3 people (myself included) at tomorrow's meeting just to make sure everything works the way it should._

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.

2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).

2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys 
2018-02-02 17:21:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Who do we need to reach out to for AWS credentials again? 
2018-02-02 17:48:05	alex.rsilva18	Sri deployed it on aws last time I remember so he should have access to it 
2018-02-02 22:02:29	srihari.shankar1	Pm me or heman  
2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-11 05:59:56	bryan.bugyi	One more thing that's less important. I found this tool that lets you edit/view GitHub Issues from the command-line. It's awesome, so I thought I'd share: https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi.

2018-02-21 20:46:32	heman-gandhi	Hi guys! I just wanted to confirm if you all were ready to deploy for HackHERS this weekend. If so, how does the bot function? Does it text like it used to last semester? 
2018-02-21 21:16:11	heman-gandhi	@bryan.bugyi ^ 
2018-02-21 21:54:34	bryan.bugyi	Is it ready?
2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think it should be. I would really like to do a live testing with at least 3 people (myself included) at tomorrow's meeting just to make sure everything works the way it should._

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-10-14 00:46:43	rz187	When were you planning to tell me this? You're telling me I prioritized this, that you will not even use for six months, over my essay that's due Monday, for nothing 
2017-10-14 00:47:15	srihari.shankar1	Is the idea bot tested 
2017-10-14 00:47:20	rz187	Yes. 
2017-10-14 00:47:27	rz187	Why the hell would i submit something I didn't test. 
2017-10-14 00:47:33	srihari.shankar1	Cause it it is I’ll deploy it 
2017-10-14 00:47:43	srihari.shankar1	But I’ll need help  
2017-10-14 00:47:51	rz187	When does the thing start 
2017-10-14 00:48:00	srihari.shankar1	You made a seperate bot right  
2017-10-14 00:48:04	rz187	Yes. 
2017-10-14 00:48:25	srihari.shankar1	Be there at 7am tomorrow  
2017-10-14 00:48:34	srihari.shankar1	At rsc  
2017-10-14 00:48:39	rz187	When does it start 
2017-10-14 00:48:47	srihari.shankar1	Doors open at 10 
2017-10-14 00:49:18	rz187	I'll be there as early as i can...maybe not 7\ 
2017-10-14 00:49:27	srihari.shankar1	Ok that’s fine 
2017-10-14 00:50:21	rz187	Next time, please communicate to the rest of the team changes in deadlines and how to get things up and running...because we started later than we would have hoped. 
2017-10-14 00:50:30	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys, I'm driving up but I'll try to be there at like 8 so I can help you guys out with anything you need [:parrot:2] 
2017-10-14 00:54:41	srihari.shankar1	@rz187 for spring things should be better cause we have more time

2017-12-06 01:10:52	bryan.bugyi	@atharva.kench @skeyupower Just a heads up. I changed the branch name from `add-mentors` to `develop` [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys 
2018-02-02 17:21:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Who do we need to reach out to for AWS credentials again? 
2018-02-02 17:48:05	alex.rsilva18	Sri deployed it on aws last time I remember so he should have access to it

2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-10-14 00:44:55	rz187	so what changes would the slack bot have over last semester's? 
2017-10-14 00:46:28	srihari.shankar1	Mainly twilio stuff  
2017-10-14 00:46:43	rz187	When were you planning to tell me this? You're telling me I prioritized this, that you will not even use for six months, over my essay that's due Monday, for nothing

2017-12-06 01:10:52	bryan.bugyi	@atharva.kench @skeyupower Just a heads up. I changed the branch name from `add-mentors` to `develop` [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2017-12-06 01:10:52	bryan.bugyi	@atharva.kench @skeyupower Just a heads up. I changed the branch name from `add-mentors` to `develop` [:+1:1] 
2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02		
2018-01-25 22:39:02		SLACK_API_KEY=xoxb-278958238756-4h4KYWlUOq0tJurbDZ4yfHWI 
2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys 
2018-02-02 17:21:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Who do we need to reach out to for AWS credentials again? 
2018-02-02 17:48:05	alex.rsilva18	Sri deployed it on aws last time I remember so he should have access to it

2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-11 05:59:56	bryan.bugyi	One more thing that's less important. I found this tool that lets you edit/view GitHub Issues from the command-line. It's awesome, so I thought I'd share: https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi.

2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:
2018-01-25 22:39:02

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think the best way to setup the mentor database would be to have each mentor use the `@<BOTID> register` command. Here's the output of the `@<BOTID> help register` command (this doesn't display unless explicitly requested so hackers can't see it):_

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think it should be. I would really like to do a live testing with at least 3 people (myself included) at tomorrow's meeting just to make sure everything works the way it should._

2018-02-21 21:54:34		_Here's the output of the `@<BOTID> help` command:_

2018-02-21 21:54:34		Hello hacker! My name is HackBot!
2018-02-21 21:54:34		
2018-02-21 21:54:34		I currently support the following commands:

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).

2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys

2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)

2018-01-25 22:39:02	bryan.bugyi	To get the slackbot program to work you need to add the following environment variable to your local machine:

2018-01-25 23:55:07	bryan.bugyi	@heman-gandhi When you get a chance, can you add @alex.rsilva18 as a contributor to the SlackRU project on GitHub? His GitHub handle is AlexSilva18. 
2018-01-26 04:15:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey guys. So I worked a lot on SlackRU during the winter break. I made a lot of changes so I decided to spend some time tonight documenting my code and specifying action items for the future. I added a lot of doc-strings and function annotations (to specify argument and return types) which I hope will make the code easier to read and understand, so make sure you run a `git pull` before you dive in. With all that said, I thought a few project announcements were probably in order:
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*GitHub Issues*: I decided to scrap the todo list that I put up on the README. I think that we should utilize GitHub Issues going forward for all new features / bugs / implementation changes that we are serious about. I have already setup a few of them. Check them out when you get a chance: https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/issues. You'll also notice that I have assigned some of those issues to some of you (as we planned out at the meeting).  Feel free to take ownership of any of these Issues that you feel you can handle. I have tried to label each Issue with the type of work it requires (e.g. Flask, Twilio, SQL, ...). Try to make sure to assign them to yourself when you start, close them when you finish, and reference them (using `#N` in your commit messages, where N is the Issue number) along the way.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*New Feature Ideas:* I replaced the todo list in the README with a section for new feature ideas/suggestions. To start it off, I added a few that I already had on my list. Check it out when you can.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Running Code:* As discussed at the meeting, you can run SlackRU using the `main.py` script. You can run all tests using the `runtests.py` script. To make sure that python3 is used by default, I made these scripts executable (you can now run them with `./main.py` and `./runtests.py`). You can also pass `-h` or `--help` to either of these scripts for usage details.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Pushing Code:* Push your changes liberally to the `develop` branch (we can always roll it back if we have to). One thing I would ask though is to make sure that all of the current tests are still passing before pushing your code (i.e. run `./runtests.py`) . As far as the `master` branch goes, I think a good rule of thumb should be to only merge in changes that have 90% or higher test coverage (checkout https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.4.2/). I think this rule will help us separate stable work from development work.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Also, please make sure that the code you commit is readable. This means descriptive function/variable names (not more comments!), short functions, and proper formatting (checkout https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

2018-01-26 04:15:29		> "Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess." - Robert C. Martin (Clean Code)
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		*Tests:* If your able (and willing), I think you should try to write unittests for your code before you commit. I've been learning a lot about the process over the last month and it's been a mind-blowing experience. I don't know how I ever wrote a working program without them.
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		If you can't write unittests, at the very least try to write testable code. This means short functions (that only do ONE thing).
2018-01-26 04:15:29		
2018-01-26 04:15:29		Finally, feel free to reach out to me with any questions, concerns, suggestions, and/or professions of hatred (or love?) that you may have. :grin:  (edited)
2018-01-26 12:42:50	atharva.kench	So I can't scrape from stack overflow because it needs human verification 
2018-02-01 16:53:03	skeyupower	I don't think I can make tonight's meeting. Sorry guys. 
2018-02-01 17:10:29	alex.rsilva18	I won't be able to make it today either, I just out of work and still have a load of projects to do, that's why I also haven't been able to get to slack, sorry guys 
2018-02-02 17:21:29	bryan.bugyi	!channel Who do we need to reach out to for AWS credentials again? 
2018-02-02 17:48:05	alex.rsilva18	Sri deployed it on aws last time I remember so he should have access to it 
2018-02-02 22:02:29	srihari.shankar1	Pm me or heman  
2018-02-08 21:43:43	alex.rsilva18	Hey guys I'm not in NB so I won't be able to go, sorry I haven't been able to get to it yet but hopefully I can get it done this weekend 
2018-02-11 05:57:23	bryan.bugyi	!channel Hey Guys. I setup a Waffle project to track our progress/issues. We are still using GitHub issues to track the project's todo items. Waffle is just a really cool way to track/manage/organize them. Check it out when you get a chance: https://waffle.io/HackRU/SlackRU.
2018-02-11 05:57:23		
2018-02-11 05:57:23		Also, I created a HackHers milestone on GitHub (https://github.com/HackRU/SlackRU/milestone/1) and linked to it all of the Issues that must be fixed/implemented in order for SlackRU to be operational in time for HackHers (02/24). If you guys are able to find time to work on this, please prioritize those issues.

2018-02-11 05:59:56	bryan.bugyi	One more thing that's less important. I found this tool that lets you edit/view GitHub Issues from the command-line. It's awesome, so I thought I'd share: https://github.com/stephencelis/ghi.

2018-02-21 20:46:32	heman-gandhi	Hi guys! I just wanted to confirm if you all were ready to deploy for HackHERS this weekend. If so, how does the bot function? Does it text like it used to last semester?

2018-02-21 21:54:34	bryan.bugyi	Is it ready?
2018-02-21 21:54:34		_I think it should be. I would really like to do a live testing with at least 3 people (myself included) at tomorrow's meeting just to make sure everything works the way it should._

2018-02-21 22:03:09	bryan.bugyi	Does it text like last year?
2018-02-21 22:03:09		
2018-02-21 22:03:09		Not yet. I don't know that will be 100% necessary though. I'm not sure how you guys were using Slack messages before, but I've got it set up so it Direct Messages mentors this year and references their name with `@<mentor-name>`, so they should receive a notification unless they explicitly disable it. This is also why we kindof need them to use the `register` command though. This way the SlackBot can easily add their Slack userid to the database. I still want to get this working, it just hasn't been a priority for me. I feel like there are still a few things that could blow up, so I've been focusing on those things. 
2018-02-21 22:09:11	bryan.bugyi	Questions/requests I have...
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I still don't know what the final Slack workspace is going to be. I need that so I can migrate the bot over.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- So the serverside portion of SlackRU (using Flask) is up and running on a AWS beanstalk, but I don't think we'll be able to run the slackbot on that server. Where did you guys run the SlackBot last year? I can run it on my desktop or something. That'll work fine if needed.
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- Will the mentors for HackHERS have shifts assigned to them? If so, when will we have that data? And in what form?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		- I will NOT be able to be there this weekend (HackHERS) unfortunately, but I can make sure to be available during the entire duration of the hackathon (except for maybe the last few hours). Is that going to cause any problems?
2018-02-21 22:09:11		
2018-02-21 22:09:11		Sorry. I know this is a lot. I figured I'd get it all out and you could read it whenever.  (edited)
