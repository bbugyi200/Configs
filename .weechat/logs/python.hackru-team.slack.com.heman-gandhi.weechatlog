2018-01-13 19:39:41	bryan.bugyi	Hey Heman. Are you on the market for a job/internship right now? 
2018-01-13 19:46:12	bryan.bugyi	Ever heard of Google's foobar challenge? They use it to recruit developers. Apparently, if you do well there's a good chance of getting an interview out of it. I just completed the first two challenges and its giving me a single-use link that I can send to a friend. I figured you would probably do well on it so, if your interested, just let me know and it's yours.  (edited)
2018-01-13 23:02:08	heman-gandhi	Honestly, I'd much rather you give it to someone else (I already failed over the summer). Thank you very much!  
2018-01-14 00:44:07	bryan.bugyi	OK. No problem. You seem like you'd do well on this. 
2018-02-23 01:11:43	bryan.bugyi	Hey. The slackbot is up and running on the HackHers slack workspace. I still don't have it running on a EC2 though. I figured you might want to run it on whatever EC2 you guys are already using to keep prices down. I'll do it, but I need access. If you want to do it, you can run it on the server by running `./main.py slackbot --config=production`. You might want to daemonize the process. I should probably create an option for that, but for now I think `nohup ./main.py slackbot --config=production & disown` should do the trick.  (edited)
2018-02-23 01:12:11	heman-gandhi	Do you wanna? 
2018-02-23 01:12:51	heman-gandhi	I'll give you the credentials. 
2018-02-23 01:13:32	bryan.bugyi	lol yeah, I can. It might have to wait until tomorrow though. I've got to get some Zs.

2018-02-23 01:16:23	bryan.bugyi	Oh okay. I had that already. I didn't realize.

2018-02-23 01:17:44	bryan.bugyi	For HackHers, before I forget, my phone number is tel:(609)500-7081 ((609)500-7081) and I'll be on the HackHers Slack workspace too if you need to reach me. I'll try to get the SlackBot online on the EC2 tomorrow.

2018-02-24 09:49:22	heman-gandhi	I'm messaging you on HackHERS slack... 
2018-02-24 09:49:30	heman-gandhi	Um, do you have the key file for the EC2? 
2018-02-24 09:49:38	heman-gandhi	@hackbot help isn't working there.
