2018-03-06 11:26:30	+iamben	dmp450: can you run "ls -l" on the full path and filename and share the result? eg output similar to    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 189815615 Dec 20 15:53 /usr/portage/distfiles/jdk-8u162-linux-x64.tar.gz
2018-03-06 11:26:51	+iamben	if the file's checksum is wrong, it may assume corrupted download and move it

2018-03-06 11:47:01	abraxxas	hey all, got a short question. im using xfce and its terminal for quite a while now, but i want to spice things up a bit. what terminals do you use in your environment, if i may ask? :D
2018-03-06 11:48:46	F0rkBomb	urxvt is super fast
2018-03-06 11:49:19	F0rkBomb	You can even setup a daemon to make it even faster
2018-03-06 11:49:50	nfk	[13:27] <ant_> which is the most lightweight? <---  if you mean low on resources, in all seriousness, why do you care - sddm for example takes up between 3 and 15 MB of RAM (depending on how much of it is shared between other processes such as the X server itself) and presumably marginally less if you have 32 bit pointers (you are all about lightweight, right?); dependency wise, there's some ugly stuff out there, sddm looks decent but it has a dependency on Qt
2018-03-06 11:49:51	nfk	so it will be either one to few pretty small compiles or probably 50-80% of Qt stack - depends on what you are using.
2018-03-06 11:50:17	bitlord	abraxxas, xfce4-terminal is pretty good, especially latest versions (few releases now)
2018-03-06 11:51:47	abraxxas	bitlord, is this the terminal that is shipped with xfce4?
2018-03-06 11:51:50	Alaric`	Hi folks, I have an odd USE puzzle ...  I'm attempting to build www-client/palemoon from https://github.com/deu/palemoon-overlay, and something that I cannot identify is focing USE=gtk3 off even if I explicitly USE=gtk3 ebuild ...
2018-03-06 11:52:08	Alaric`	Anyone have any ideas what could possibly be doing it?
2018-03-06 11:52:26	Alaric`	s/focing/forcing/
2018-03-06 11:52:37	bitlord	abraxxas, it's part of xfce project, not sure what you have installed, if you run xfce4-terminal it should open it, if you have it installed
2018-03-06 11:54:02	abraxxas	bitlord, okay ill try it out ty
2018-03-06 11:54:29	+iamben	Alaric`: https://github.com/deu/palemoon-overlay/blob/master/profiles/package.use.mask
2018-03-06 11:54:44	deu	Alaric`: gtk3 support is really broken on pale moon, hence the use is marked. if you REALLY want to enable it you could unmask it
2018-03-06 11:54:56	drunk_foxx	hi guys, I was trying to compile rtl8723de wifi driver for 4.15.7-r1 kernel and got the following error after "make": https://is.gd/B9wLdd as I understand from this error message and issues on github, this driver would not compile for that kernel version unless it's modified in some way as the new kernel does not support init_timer function now, having timer_setup instead (whatever that means, I am not experienced in C).
2018-03-06 11:55:22	drunk_foxx	so could anyone give me an idea of how do I "patch" this for the new kernel? or maybe help with with that
2018-03-06 11:55:33	nfk	BL4DE, with all seriousness, if you're going to be full tinfoil, just go with some kind of MAC scheme. tomoyo is easy to setup, as is smack, allegedly. Gentoo also has selinux but i have never understood that nsa witchcraft. Then there's apparmor that's also badly integrated (last time i checked on gentoo) with some services like systemd and lxd but looking at its permission syntax made my eyes bleed.
2018-03-06 11:56:28	Alaric`	deu -- ah, so.  No wonder I couldn't enable it.  :)
2018-03-06 11:56:44	deu	yep. I really don't recommend doing so
2018-03-06 11:57:10	Alaric`	Where do I look to *see* that a USE is masked?  Because I was utterly baffled as to what was forcing it off
2018-03-06 11:57:26	+iamben	Alaric`: you'll see (-gtk3) in the emerge -pv output
2018-03-06 11:57:34	deu	masked USE flags should appear between parenthesis
2018-03-06 11:57:38	deu	yeah that
2018-03-06 11:58:01	+iamben	as far as locating the particular mask file entry in the profile, that's not an exact science
2018-03-06 11:58:13	Alaric`	aaaaaaaah
2018-03-06 11:58:25	+iamben	pretty simple in an overlay like this but more complicated if it's masked somewhere in the huge /usr/portage/profiles/ profile stack
2018-03-06 11:58:27	deu	though if it's from an overlay, it'll probably be there
2018-03-06 11:58:27	Alaric`	I saw that but never realized that I didn't know what it meant
2018-03-06 11:58:34	nfk	[18:48] <F0rkBomb> urxvt is super fast <-- not true, konsole is the only really fast terminal emulator, urxvt might not be the slowest but all except konsole will in my experience be observably slow to print many lines which can become a problem when processes behind those lines are required to complete printing before the next one can begin

2018-03-06 12:00:58	nfk	ant_, oh and I forgot one of the most important bits, those 3-15 MB taken up by SDDM - they will almost certainly be swapped out if necessary as the sddm process has CPU time of 0.0s in almost 9h period, meaning its code is not actually being run, which makes it available for swapping out, provided that that bit of memory is not locked (not sure if sddm's is locked or not)

2018-03-06 19:12:41	nordmike3	yhorm: One of /usr/portage/metadata/timestamp* files should be right one.
2018-03-06 19:22:07	+grknight	mrwater: if you install acpilight, then you get a tool that most brightness keys will interact with
2018-03-06 19:22:16	+grknight	(at least in xorg)
2018-03-06 19:26:30	mrwater	+grknight: Ok, thanks. I was wondering why they didn't have something like that in the Thinkpad Special Keys page on the wiki
2018-03-06 19:27:54	+grknight	mrwater: it replaces the xbacklight command which is strictly for xorg (and only certain drivers at that)
2018-03-06 19:31:04	mrwater	+grknight should a acpid restart and xorg restart allow me to then use the backlight keys? Or should I do a reboot?
2018-03-06 19:31:58	mrwater	Actually hang on, I'll just test that out
2018-03-06 19:34:39	mrwater	Nope. The answer is no
2018-03-06 19:45:06	jcmdln	mrwater: try setting your screen brightness with xbacklight, you may need to bind the keys manually if it works via cli

2018-03-06 19:52:24	+wraeth	no, there's no gui installer. the supported installation method is via the Handbook -> https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page
2018-03-06 19:52:47	TinyTimmyTokyo	from the minimal cd, is there a way to get the current temperature of the CPU? I want to see if thermal throttling is why this install is being so slow
2018-03-06 19:52:50	+wraeth	the livedvd is a gui environment, but the installation itself is still done via console
2018-03-06 19:52:53	manjaroi3	ok yeah i installed it years ago i just wondered if they updated to that

2018-03-06 19:53:27	TinyTimmyTokyo	i have a hunch that it could be, because the cooling system in this laptop doesn't seem to be well-designed at all

2018-03-06 19:56:26	mrwater	jcmdln Thanks for the recommendation, I think I'm going to try to go without both and do the brightness controls from scratch. I mean, the acpi events show up and the wiki tells you how to use them but I wanted to see if there was a more native solution before I tried that
2018-03-06 19:57:13	mrwater	TinyTimmyTokyo You sure? I seem to remember arch having an ncurses installer x) And that was 7 years ago
2018-03-06 19:57:17	jcmdln	After a few installs over the years I wrote a shell script to install my ideal Gentoo
2018-03-06 19:57:25	TinyTimmyTokyo	mrwater: arch doesn't have an installer either
2018-03-06 19:57:59	jcmdln	arch used to have an installer but it was dropped due to lack of support
2018-03-06 19:58:17	mrwater	Whoa, no kidding
2018-03-06 19:58:22	mrwater	Just looked it up
2018-03-06 19:58:44	jcmdln	I think there's still an unofficial one floating around their wiki
2018-03-06 19:59:44	mrwater	The difference being, of course, that if you want to install Gentoo you'll need a lot of time on your hands, especially at first
2018-03-06 20:00:49	jcmdln	true, there's a bit of investment needed to read the handbook
2018-03-06 20:02:16	mrwater	I did not know that, and now I'm just trying to get a system with brightness controls and a working urxvt setup so that I can write
2018-03-06 20:02:29	mrwater	Oh crap, I just realized I have to emerge latex. Fantastic
2018-03-06 20:03:36	jcmdln	hmm, I use xbacklight with i3 and manually bind my brightness keys
2018-03-06 20:03:48	Zilla	i installed blackarch and that has a really nice installer for arch
2018-03-06 20:04:05	+grknight	jcmdln: acpilight replaces xbacklight as the original xbacklight does not work on all drivers
2018-03-06 20:04:19	Zilla	and im running manjaro was awesome installer gui super easy
2018-03-06 20:04:55	+grknight	Zilla: it's not possible to have an installer in Gentoo as every install is different.  possibly down to the package options
2018-03-06 20:07:23	Zilla	but gentoo is so fun
2018-03-06 20:07:45	Zilla	yeah i remember tho a while ago gentoo has some sort of installer
2018-03-06 20:08:02	Zilla	like someone said tho they discontinued it
2018-03-06 20:08:44	+wraeth	Zilla: it's because the installation of gentoo is so customisable/varied that creating an automated installer will either be detrimental or excessively complex
2018-03-06 20:08:52	+kurly	in #gentoo linux support, we support gentoo as installed by the handbook
2018-03-06 20:10:14	Zilla	wraeth: yeah i hear ya, i just was wondering if they had something alittle easier to do because i wanted to install gentoo tonight but i dont have time right now to set it up so ill have to wait
2018-03-06 20:11:05	jcmdln	probably best to map out your package.use, make.conf, and other portage files first
2018-03-06 20:13:23	BenLand100	After years of Living With The Issue™ I've finally discovered that the 'headphone' channel in alsa has to be unmuted and turned up to hear sound from my internal speakers - the 'speaker' channel appears to do nothing at all (headphones when plugged in use 'headphone' channel also, speakers auto mute, 'speaker' channel still does nothing) - but when I unplug headphones something auto mutes the 'headphone' channel! how can I stop this?
2018-03-06 20:14:20	BenLand100	(using pulseaudio if it matters)

2018-03-06 20:44:44	mrwater	Seems like March 13, 2017. According to the kernel archives that was kernel 4.10.10 or so
2018-03-06 20:48:49	+grknight	nordmike: that should be in expansion.py

2018-03-06 20:58:33	kamiyaa	Is /proc and /sys suppose to be empty when the computer is turned off?

2018-03-06 21:00:08	kerframil	kamiyaa: they don't need to be emptied because they are pseudo-filesystems. they contain only what the kernel makes them appear to contain at runtime.
2018-03-06 21:00:17	artaslove	sooo.... if I'm just getting around to switching to a 17.0 profile now should I just abandon all hope? ;)
2018-03-06 21:00:19	R0b0t1	There's no physical file (as far as I am aware) backing the things in either of those places
2018-03-06 21:00:33	R0b0t1	In /dev, there are things, but they are not really files
2018-03-06 21:00:36	kamiyaa	Okay, i was just migrating my gentoo to another ssd today
2018-03-06 21:00:44	kamiyaa	And it copied a bunch of proc and sys stuff
2018-03-06 21:01:00	kamiyaa	Its the same with dev?
2018-03-06 21:01:14	kerframil	you shouldn't do that. but with /dev, it gets a bit more interesting.
2018-03-06 21:01:25	earendil	modern /dev is autocreated on the fly
2018-03-06 21:01:29	nordmike	grknight: When I run env-update it writes "importerror no module env_update"
2018-03-06 21:01:42	kerframil	on a normal gentoo system, the /dev directory on the root filesystem does - and should - contain a limited set of device nodes, even though they are not used in practice
2018-03-06 21:01:50	kamiyaa	kerframil: do what?
2018-03-06 21:01:55	earendil	but way back in the day, and still in some cases, you can have a /dev populated by persistent files/block devices/etc.
2018-03-06 21:02:03	earendil	(everyone on a unix box is a file, more or less)
2018-03-06 21:02:11	+grknight	nordmike: that sounds very much like a python issue
2018-03-06 21:02:15	kerframil	kamiyaa: copy the contents of a mounted /proc and /sys to their respective directories on a target root filesystem. doing so makes so sense.
2018-03-06 21:02:29	R0b0t1	mrwater: kurly: I had found that, but from the patch date and this (https://kernelnewbies.org/LinuxVersions) it looks like my kernel should support that API yet it does not
2018-03-06 21:02:43	earendil	you wouldn't want to copy a running (e)udev filestructure into another /dev
2018-03-06 21:02:48	kerframil	kamiyaa: either copy while the filesystem are offline or do something like `mkdir /mnt/root, mount -o bind / /mnt/root`, then copy from /mnt/root instead.
2018-03-06 21:02:51	R0b0t1	FAN_MODIFY_DIR is unset after including sys/fanotify.h
2018-03-06 21:02:58	kamiyaa	kerframil: whoops xD, i just did a rsync -avz / newssd
2018-03-06 21:03:08	R0b0t1	grep -R of /usr/src/linux turns up nothing
2018-03-06 21:03:09	kerframil	kamiyaa: that way, you get a view of the contents of the filesystem backing / only
2018-03-06 21:03:36	kamiyaa	Yea, I shouldve booted into a live cd
2018-03-06 21:03:48	mrwater	R0b0t1: ah, ok, understood

2018-03-06 21:18:37	tdr	kind of an odd place to keep your portage btw
2018-03-06 21:22:28	atsuko	is the best way to go about editing sxiv source before installing it to do `ebuild $(equery w sxiv) fetch unpack`
2018-03-06 21:22:37	atsuko	and then `ebuild $(equery w sxiv) compile install qmerge` after i edit the code
2018-03-06 21:23:10	atsuko	?
2018-03-06 21:24:53	tdr	the sustainable way would be to write a patch file
2018-03-06 21:26:05	atsuko	i suppose so
2018-03-06 21:27:20	atsuko	then i can tell portage to apply the patch on each update/rebuild of sxiv, right?
2018-03-06 21:28:13	tdr	there is a documented way to place a patch so it finds it on emerge yes
2018-03-06 21:28:35	atsuko	neat
2018-03-06 21:29:16	nordmike	tdr: system portage is broken.

2018-03-06 21:45:37	motherfscker	I'm not even sure how one would go about submitting commits to a project through email. Can you turn git commits into a file?
2018-03-06 21:46:14	R0b0t1`	Yes it will automatically produce something you can attach
2018-03-06 21:46:16	+wraeth	motherfscker: yes, either by generating and attaching a patch, or by using gits built-in send-email function
2018-03-06 21:46:41	+wraeth	your favourite search engine can elaborate further ;)
2018-03-06 21:47:20	zergofray	hey guys. I've been using gentoo for 4 years now and there is one thing that still always frustrates me. I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong
2018-03-06 21:47:34	zergofray	when using languages that have their own package managers, such as pip or npm or cabal
2018-03-06 21:47:57	zergofray	is it really reasonable to download the (usually very long out of date) gentoo versions of the packages through portage
2018-03-06 21:48:13	zergofray	rather than get the newest versions though the specific package manager?
2018-03-06 21:49:04	+kurly	zergofray: if you use an alternate package manager, don't do it as root
2018-03-06 21:49:38	motherfscker	anybody here got a librem laptop? I'm getting one int he mail tomorrow.
2018-03-06 21:49:46	motherfscker	I can't wait to install gentoo on that thing
2018-03-06 21:50:12	+wraeth	motherfscker: sounds like something better discussed in #gentoo-chat - we try to stick pretty closely to support here :)
2018-03-06 21:50:19	motherfscker	srry ;p
2018-03-06 21:50:49	mrwater	TIL there's a #gentoo-chat

2018-03-06 21:51:45	zergofray	kurly: sure, but suppose I want to install program foo that has bar as a dependency. I downloaded bar from cabal, for example, so it is installed. When I emerge foo, and its ebuild lists bar as a dependency, why can't that dependency be tracked through cabal rather than a new copy being downloaded/compiled?
2018-03-06 21:52:03	+wraeth	mrwater: technically it's an unofficial (community-managed) channel, but there's https://www.gentoo.org/get-involved/irc-channels/all-channels.html that lists most of the others
2018-03-06 21:52:07	zergofray	It sounds to me like this would be a great feature
2018-03-06 21:52:11	+kurly	zergofray: because you shouldn't be using an alternate package manager as root; portage manages portage packages
2018-03-06 21:52:30	+kurly	zergofray: it's also a *LOT* more difficult than you might think, or it might already exist
2018-03-06 21:52:35	zergofray	kurly: so I'm stuck with either duplicated packages or out-of-date packages?
2018-03-06 21:52:47	▷	kurly shrugs
2018-03-06 21:53:13	stiltr	You could always help the maintainers with updated ebuilds
2018-03-06 21:53:17	+wraeth	zergofray: you can file a bug for a version bump, or bump the ebuild yourself if you're so inclined
2018-03-06 21:53:45	zergofray	wraeth: I know, I've done that in the past, but it feels like an uphill battle
2018-03-06 21:53:51	zergofray	What benefit is there to doing it this way?
2018-03-06 21:54:03	+kurly	"it"?
2018-03-06 21:54:05	zergofray	Would there be any interested in allowing portage to 'hook' into other package managers?
2018-03-06 21:54:34	mrwater	+wraeth thanks, bookmark'd
2018-03-06 21:54:51	zergofray	(ex having the ebuild for bar call 'cabal install bar' rather than download sources and build outside)
2018-03-06 21:54:59	+wraeth	zergofray: an interesting idea. might be worth discussing in #gentoo-portage or on the gentoo-dev mailing list
2018-03-06 21:55:19	+kurly	zergofray: it's more that this is the reality than the ideal situation; your ideas are good, but it's just not that simple. :\
2018-03-06 21:55:22	+wraeth	zergofray: for now, though, we don't recommend bypassing portage and installing things as root outside of the package manager as it can lead to breakage

2018-03-06 22:46:43	mrwater	kurly it's in an overlay

2018-03-06 22:53:26	mrwater	kurly The problem is that it's masked and I want it unmasked. I just did the keyword thing because it worked for some people on google. The overlay is ROKO__

2018-03-06 23:07:06	jcmdln	Not to be crude but I'm not sure what the confusion would be. Lightning ports? Not sure what an email client would need with them.

2018-03-06 23:11:50	Case_Of	i do not know if i want to bother myself to convince people
2018-03-06 23:12:24	Case_Of	it's maybe not worth it

2018-03-06 23:19:40	Bearcat	true (and the command i was looking for was equery g [package])
2018-03-06 23:20:09	Case_Of	ah i did not read the end of your sentence sorry
2018-03-06 23:20:16	Case_Of	i was able to answer you
2018-03-06 23:20:54	Bearcat	i'm not complaining, just giving feedback. I'd always assumed that the depenfancy graph worked in the other direction. Good to know.
2018-03-06 23:21:49	Case_Of	Bearcat: ah yeah equery g for given packages dependencies and equery d for what depends on the given package
2018-03-06 23:22:19	Bearcat	of course g gives me all ebuilds regardless of wether i have that version installed, but that's ok
2018-03-06 23:22:39	Case_Of	Bearcat: yes equery is incomplete
2018-03-06 23:22:58	+kurly	Bearcat: there's always the -L/--library option to revdep-rebuild, or you could look at the output of 'emerge -pvc readline'
2018-03-06 23:23:59	Bearcat	kurly: true. right now i'm fighting with an annoying lua version conflict so rebuilds don't work so well
2018-03-06 23:24:14	tdr	Bearcat, unmasked one?
2018-03-06 23:24:46	Bearcat	tdr: yeah
2018-03-06 23:25:08	tdr	Bearcat, heh empathy granted
2018-03-06 23:25:28	Bearcat	tdr: thank you. Why are all those versions masked anyhow?
2018-03-06 23:25:36	tdr	Bearcat, because "things" break
2018-03-06 23:25:57	Bearcat	tdr: well so do my plates, but i don't stop serving dinner!
2018-03-06 23:26:16	tdr	Bearcat, lua itself changed or else things with it link too specifically or something, like anything using it needs rebuilt when you touch it nowdays
2018-03-06 23:26:31	Case_Of	Bearcat: equery l -pm lua will give you mask reasons
2018-03-06 23:26:38	tdr	at least between the 5.1 vs 5.2 or 5.3 versions

2018-03-06 23:31:23	tdr	Bearcat, those "little scripting languages" ...
2018-03-06 23:31:37	+wraeth	korans: not sure, sorry.. grknight might have a little more of an idea when he gets back on, but then again may not..
2018-03-06 23:31:44	Bearcat	oh for ... ! Lua 5.3 was masked back in Decelmer 2016 because someone retired ... great ...
2018-03-06 23:31:55	Bearcat	*december
2018-03-06 23:32:17	tdr	Bearcat, not because the package itself couldnt be maintained tho, it was dealing with what happens when versions change
2018-03-06 23:33:20	Bearcat	so things heavily depend on it like things depend on python 2.7, but in this case lua is not slotted.
2018-03-06 23:34:14	tdr	Bearcat, afaik it never was, even when other things were
2018-03-06 23:34:14	+kurly	er, lua is certainly slotted
2018-03-06 23:34:20	Bearcat	Case_Of: and by the way, the search error in zsh doesn't happen when you're in a tty or urxvt. Only certain terminals. It's really wierd. I just re-emerged vte and libvterm in case that was it, but nope!
2018-03-06 23:34:49	Case_Of	mmmh ok
2018-03-06 23:34:53	Bearcat	kurly: i can't have both 5.1.5 and 5.3.3 installed at the same time
2018-03-06 23:35:01	tdr	Bearcat, emerge -vpt one of them, it might show something obvious thats a dep
2018-03-06 23:35:14	Bearcat	kurly: which is what i need to have
2018-03-06 23:35:31	+kurly	Bearcat: correct, :0 is blocked by :5.1, :5.2, :5.3
2018-03-06 23:35:58	+kurly	Bearcat: similar situation with llvm:0 and other slots
2018-03-06 23:36:28	Bearcat	tdr: thanks, but no dice.
2018-03-06 23:36:35	Case_Of	is there a way to ask portage to not install packages files in a specific directory?
2018-03-06 23:36:49	tdr	Case_Of, what do you mean?

2018-03-06 23:37:24	tdr	Bearcat, did you meantion a readline change?
2018-03-06 23:39:29	Case_Of	tdr kurly i should have specified in the file system
2018-03-06 23:40:04	tdr	Case_Of, ok, wondered if you meant protecting a directory or where to store binary packages you were building
2018-03-06 23:42:47	Case_Of	and i also should have said in make.conf of course
2018-03-06 23:43:18	Bearcat	tdr: yes. I upgraded from 6.3_p8-r3 to 7.0_p3
2018-03-06 23:44:14	Bearcat	but that was back on 1/04 and this is a this-week problem.
2018-03-06 23:44:17	tdr	Bearcat, i remember that changing to either 6 or 7 was different.
2018-03-06 23:45:31	korans	wraeth: I think I know why... I've set acl's from my host system on the files in question clearly it doesn't like them
2018-03-06 23:45:48	Bearcat	tdr: as in I had to change configuration files?
2018-03-06 23:46:00	tdr	its nothing something basic like util-linux (setterm or similar messed up maybe?)
2018-03-06 23:48:30	korans	wraeth: removing my acls worked
2018-03-06 23:48:32	Case_Of	in INSTALL_MASK does the ending slash should be added or not?
2018-03-06 23:49:21	+kurly	Case_Of: it is described well in 'man 5 portage'
2018-03-06 23:49:36	+kurly	err

2018-03-07 02:36:10	Triffid_Hunter	amitprakash: sure, grab an old release from their git repo or whatever rcs they use and build it yourself. best to not mix it with your system since you have only one thing that wants it and you don't want other programs getting confused
2018-03-07 02:37:01	amitprakash	I'm going to try to get a slotted install
2018-03-07 02:37:45	amitprakash	Triffid_Hunter, the weird thing is.. equivalent version of the package on debian based distro ship it as libsasl.so.2
2018-03-07 02:45:00	nordmike	Sur3: Thank you, I've updated portage. But it doesn't work now.
2018-03-07 02:45:39	nordmike	> When I run env-update it writes "importerror no module env_update"
2018-03-07 02:46:24	Case_Of	anybody can answer?
2018-03-07 02:47:55	Sur3	Case_Of, that link seems to be down?!
2018-03-07 02:48:04	Case_Of	ah?
2018-03-07 02:48:23	Case_Of	probably that paste service is having issues
2018-03-07 02:48:25	Case_Of	one second
2018-03-07 02:48:49	Case_Of	Sur3: https://ptpb.pw/ONRP
2018-03-07 02:48:57	djdunn	nordmike: dispatch-conf work?
2018-03-07 02:49:17	djdunn	nordmike: portageutils?
2018-03-07 02:51:09	BL4DE	if I run emerge -avt =www-client/firefox-58.0.1  how will package accept keywords affect future updates of firefox? will I have to manually change the keyword when newer firefox version comes out?
2018-03-07 02:52:23	Triffid_Hunter	BL4DE: only if you want the newer one and it's keyworded.. why not just keyword www-client/firefox if you want always the latest?
2018-03-07 02:52:30	+perfinion	if you emerge that specific version you are asking it for that specific version, it will not update it later
2018-03-07 02:52:44	djdunn	BL4DE: you can use just www-client/firefox instead of =www-client/firefox-58.0.1
2018-03-07 02:53:01	Sur3	you can use ~ prefix instead of = prefix to include -r* revisions
2018-03-07 02:53:02	BL4DE	djdunn: but it emerges firefox 52 ESR
2018-03-07 02:53:21	djdunn	BL4DE: put www-client/firefox in /etc/portage/package.keyword
2018-03-07 02:53:25	+perfinion	if you put that in package.accept_keywords and emerge jsut generic www-client/firefox then it update to whatever versions are keyworded
2018-03-07 02:53:38	Case_Of	Sur3: sources probably need a patch?
2018-03-07 02:54:08	+perfinion	yeah if you put a line without version then emerge will pick the highest it can
2018-03-07 02:54:15	BL4DE	Triffid_Hunter: if I do that, then I have to ask how often does firefox get bumped on gentoo? maybe I should stick to firefox-bin then
2018-03-07 02:54:28	+perfinion	BL4DE: waht are you trying to do?
2018-03-07 02:54:47	+perfinion	BL4DE: you want specifically that version? or any 58.* version? or how?
2018-03-07 02:54:59	+perfinion	or you always want the latest latest?
2018-03-07 02:55:08	Triffid_Hunter	BL4DE: no idea, I've capped mine at 56 for now
2018-03-07 02:55:57	Sur3	Case_Of, yes where did you get that ebuild? Seems to be a problem with the vala code.. Cannot convert from Gee.ArrayList<FontManager.Filter> to Gee.Collection<FontManager.Collection>
2018-03-07 02:55:58	BL4DE	perfinion: would like current firefox version instead of 52 ESR. current is 58 (latest). not sure if this is going to become a problem compiling new version every time it get's bumped
2018-03-07 02:56:24	Case_Of	Sur3: that's what i saw, it's from sk-overlay
2018-03-07 02:56:36	djdunn	BL4DE: no just add it in package.keyword
2018-03-07 02:56:38	+perfinion	BL4DE: the just put plain "www-client/firefox" in your package.accept_keywords and it'll be the latest always
2018-03-07 02:56:57	BL4DE	thanks :)
2018-03-07 02:57:15	+perfinion	BL4DE: if you want to wait to update it later, when you are doing emerge -avDu @world, you can always add --exclude=firefox
2018-03-07 02:57:42	+perfinion	BL4DE: but i would not put it off too long, things like browsers always have security issues so you'll want to stay reasonably up to date
2018-03-07 02:58:14	+perfinion	i frequently do --exclude=chromium to update everythignelse first then do chromium afterwards for example
2018-03-07 02:58:33	djdunn	and libreoffice
2018-03-07 02:58:43	+perfinion	i use googledocs instead :P
2018-03-07 02:59:31	xacktm	need that ppt to pdf converter though ;(
2018-03-07 02:59:46	+perfinion	BL4DE: also, be aware if you update firefox 52->58, you cannot go back easily, the profiles changed you'd have to delete your profile and start over
2018-03-07 02:59:51	djdunn	powerpoints never should have been invented
2018-03-07 03:00:44	Sur3	Case_Of, did you try running the -9999 ebuild instead, probably that bug is already fixed in git..
2018-03-07 03:02:51	Case_Of	Sur3: like this one https://github.com/FontManager/master/commit/b39c4969a80b643ac0eabbb7ea0ae75dca76c257
2018-03-07 03:02:55	Case_Of	?
2018-03-07 03:03:20	Sur3	Case_Of, yes like that^^
2018-03-07 03:03:29	djdunn	Case_Of: the 9999 ebuild builds from the git master
2018-03-07 03:04:18	djdunn	Case_Of: or if you dont want to do that you can take that one commit and make yourself a patch
2018-03-07 03:04:29	Case_Of	djdunn: yes i will do so
2018-03-07 03:04:35	nordmike	djdunn: I'm not near that machine now. I think portage-utils should work and dispatch-conf should not.
2018-03-07 03:05:33	djdunn	Case_Of: its pretty easy to add your own patches in /etc/portage/patches so portage applies them
2018-03-07 03:05:42	Case_Of	i know
2018-03-07 03:06:11	Case_Of	i'm playing with git to extract a patch file from that commit
2018-03-07 03:08:59	BL4DE	"package.keywords which modifies effective KEYWORDS (rather than ACCEPT_KEYWORDS)." don't quite understand the difference between package.accept_keywords and package.keywords. man page says one overwrites the other, but otherwise?
2018-03-07 03:09:09	Case_Of	git format-patch -1 b39c4969a80b643ac0eabbb7ea0ae75dca76c257 will do the thing
2018-03-07 03:09:38	djdunn	BL4DE: you can make /etc/portage/package.keywords/package.accept_keywords
2018-03-07 03:09:53	djdunn	BL4DE: or /etc/portage/package.keywords
2018-03-07 03:10:48	djdunn	BL4DE: probably should go with package.keywords/package.accept_keywords
2018-03-07 03:11:50	BL4DE	djdunn: thanks
2018-03-07 03:14:15	korans	djdunn: why would you want to do that?
2018-03-07 03:20:13	djdunn	why does xorg ignore my input devices
2018-03-07 03:20:18	djdunn	it doesnt even try to load them
2018-03-07 03:25:26	Takiito	I wanted to run plasma with wayland. But I only get a black screen. Could it be that I need to use the nouveau drivers instead of nvidia?
2018-03-07 03:25:48	djdunn	Takiito: yeah i dont think nvidia drivers support wayland yet
2018-03-07 03:25:54	djdunn	dont quote me on that tho
2018-03-07 03:26:08	Takiito	ok :)
2018-03-07 03:27:43	djdunn	Takiito: i dont know what its status is atm but i do remember it not being supported in the past
2018-03-07 03:27:49	djdunn	i donno i have a amd card
2018-03-07 03:29:02	Takiito	hmm, no it seems wayland support was added in 2016
2018-03-07 03:29:17	Takiito	I even compiled nvidia-drivers with wayland use flag
2018-03-07 03:29:34	Case_Of	well i'm not lucky https://ptpb.pw/m_ki
2018-03-07 03:29:52	djdunn	Takiito: oh its probably supported then if it has the wayland use flag
2018-03-07 03:30:28	Case_Of	djdunn: should i definitely use the 9999
2018-03-07 03:32:54	Takiito	Oh, I found a forum post where it is stated that wayland requires the logind interface. Is it save to add USE="elogind". (I don't have systemd)
2018-03-07 03:34:33	bouma	should it be fairly straightforward to burn an iso from the minimalcd ?
2018-03-07 03:35:22	djdunn	Case_Of: donno
2018-03-07 03:35:36	djdunn	Case_Of: it might not even compile, it might not work correctly
2018-03-07 03:35:45	Case_Of	djdunn: i'm trying
2018-03-07 03:36:00	Case_Of	djdunn: it builds fine to begin
2018-03-07 03:36:20	djdunn	Case_Of: some developers keep a working git tree seperate from the development git tree for 9999
2018-03-07 03:37:14	Case_Of	djdunn: not here apparently https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scriptkitties/overlay/master/media-gfx/font-manager/font-manager-9999-r2.ebuild
2018-03-07 03:39:55	djdunn	Case_Of: thing about it is that evertime you run it it may be building a diffrent "version"

2018-03-07 03:47:38	BL4DE	not sure about plasma but wayland does work with plasma. but last I heard 2D opengl acceleration doesn't work with proprietary drivers and KMS is a must so it won't work on legacy nvidia drivers
2018-03-07 03:48:08	BL4DE	*wayland does work with nvidia but maybe still no opengl acceleration
2018-03-07 03:51:06	djdunn	libinput doesnt work... evdev doesnt work...

2018-03-07 17:33:32	+wraeth	how long ago (or, specifically, how old package-wise) did you have it working in Xorg? perhaps a (recent?) update has caused conflict? or requires a config section to specifically look for it?
2018-03-07 17:33:43	djdunn	less than a week
2018-03-07 17:33:47	+wraeth	hmm
2018-03-07 17:34:00	djdunn	this is a reinstall of that box
2018-03-07 17:34:41	djdunn	hmm
2018-03-07 17:34:46	djdunn	i had a keyboard.conf file in xorg.conf.d that i put there again but that dosent seem to work now
2018-03-07 17:35:02	djdunn	wraeth: i reinstalled cause i tried to install selinux
2018-03-07 17:35:15	djdunn	and after that thats when i noticed the keyboard didnt work
2018-03-07 17:35:53	djdunn	then i got tired of trying to setup selinux and uninstalled selinux, then it still didnt work so i said f it and reinstalled everything from a stage 3
2018-03-07 17:37:09	+wraeth	i wouldn't expect selinux to have affected it, particularly when you're running on a non-selinux system now..
2018-03-07 17:37:21	+wraeth	can you try `udevadm monitor` and replug the device?
2018-03-07 17:37:26	+wraeth	see if udev actually sees it
2018-03-07 17:37:58	djdunn	no
2018-03-07 17:39:09	djdunn	do i need a udev rule?
2018-03-07 17:39:32	+wraeth	can you try the same test with the mouse, just to make sure i'm right in guessing you should see some output from udev
2018-03-07 17:39:35	+wraeth	?
2018-03-07 17:40:21	djdunn	all kinds of stuff
2018-03-07 17:41:25	artaslove	um, I don't think ps/2 is hot-swappable
2018-03-07 17:41:27	+wraeth	so it looks like udev is the culprit rather than Xorg.. do you remember if you had to create a manual udev rule? or if you updated udev between the keyboard working and not working?
2018-03-07 17:42:09	djdunn	yeah eudev got reinstalled for selinux
2018-03-07 17:42:14	djdunn	and i dont remember if i had a manual rule
2018-03-07 17:42:21	djdunn	15 years ago was a long time
2018-03-07 17:42:34	derek01	Hey guys, im trying to get network support working for a hyper-v install. Works fine for the install, but i must be missing something in the kernel.
2018-03-07 17:42:36	djdunn	though im not sure if udev was around back then maybe hal
2018-03-07 17:42:45	djdunn	well i remember before hal
2018-03-07 17:42:45	+wraeth	artaslove: i honestly can't remember, but if it wasn't i'd expect the keyboard to not be working now (which, given the responses, i'm guessing isn't the case)
2018-03-07 17:43:35	+wraeth	djdunn: maybe try downgrading (e)udev one or two versions, just to test?
2018-03-07 17:43:54	djdunn	theres only one version of eudev in the tree
2018-03-07 17:43:58	+wraeth	i mean, hal hasn't been around for a while, and if the keyboard was working last week...
2018-03-07 17:44:07	djdunn	i could try udev?
2018-03-07 17:44:14	numan	hi
2018-03-07 17:44:31	+wraeth	djdunn: sure - (e)udev should be drop-ins for each other
2018-03-07 17:44:31	numan	How can I solve this problem : EXT4-fs (sda3): couldn't mount as ext3 due to feature incompatibilities
2018-03-07 17:45:12	hlmjr	numan, I'm thinking enable ext3 support in your kernel, perhaps?
2018-03-07 17:45:33	+wraeth	derek01: `lspci -k` from the live environment (where the network is working) should tell you the kernel driver(s) being used for your pci hardware, so you can locate and enable it in your kernel
2018-03-07 17:46:27	derek01	lemme reboot back into the livecd and see what it says again, I thought i got it all
2018-03-07 17:46:55	djdunn	udev installed a bunch of other rules
2018-03-07 17:48:37	djdunn	udev didnt pick it up with udevadm monitor
2018-03-07 17:48:43	numan	but it s an ext4
2018-03-07 17:48:50	numan	file
2018-03-07 17:48:57	+wraeth	djdunn: did you restart udev first?
2018-03-07 17:49:08	dgurney	numan, in that case it isn't really a problem, unless you're trying to purposefully mount it as ext3
2018-03-07 17:49:15	djdunn	yeah restarted udev
2018-03-07 17:50:54	+wraeth	djdunn: then i'm at a loss.. if you want to stick with eudev then i'd suggest reinstalling that now; but otherwise you might need to wait around for someone more familiar with *udevs magic :/
2018-03-07 17:51:42	numan	i will try that
2018-03-07 17:52:02	numan	what can happen if I copy  /proc/mounts to /etc/mtab and reboot
2018-03-07 17:52:23	+wraeth	numan: why would you want to do that?
2018-03-07 17:53:10	derek01	wraeth: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/df9AT0XT6Ad4igO67eiD/
2018-03-07 17:53:23	numan	to solve the issue of reading an ext4 as ext3
2018-03-07 17:53:26	numan	?
2018-03-07 17:53:44	dgurney	why are you trying to do that?
2018-03-07 17:53:46	kerframil	numan: it isn't. in fact, it's stating the exact opposite.
2018-03-07 17:54:15	kerframil	numan: it can only mount as ext4 because the feature flags forbid any earlier version. if the message bothers you, specify rootfstype.
2018-03-07 17:54:22	dgurney	^
2018-03-07 17:55:29	numan	sorry how do someone specify rootfstype I am new to gentoo
2018-03-07 17:55:37	User_	Hey I'm having a problem
2018-03-07 17:55:48	dgurney	numan, you add it to your kernel command line
2018-03-07 17:55:55	User_	I just ordered the librem 13 laptop and when I boot the keyboards | key shows up as a < key
2018-03-07 17:56:15	dgurney	if you are using grub, you edit the appropriate line in /etc/default/grub and regenerate the config file
2018-03-07 17:56:15	kerframil	numan: are you using grub-mkconfig, normally?
2018-03-07 17:56:23	User_	I checked to see if I might have used the wrong keyboard version, and strangely enough selecting UK (which I did not purchase) fixes it... But then messes up other keys
2018-03-07 17:57:20	numan	yes
2018-03-07 17:57:30	numan	grub-mkconfig I use
2018-03-07 17:57:39	numan	I am on open-rc
2018-03-07 17:58:17	kerframil	numan: add rootfstype=ext4 to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX in /etc/default/grub, then re-generate with grub-mkconfig
2018-03-07 17:59:29	derek01	booting the livecd i get eth0 just fine with a working connection. lspci shows https://paste.pound-python.org/show/df9AT0XT6Ad4igO67eiD/ and i dont think anything is network related?
2018-03-07 18:00:02	djdunn	wraeth: well thanks, i know wore what i think the problem is now
2018-03-07 18:00:44	numan	thanks

2018-03-07 18:08:13	+wraeth	nawks: am i good with it how? i don't use evdev personally, if that's what you mean (at least, i don't think i do - may be on one or two systems i don't have access to at teh moment)
2018-03-07 18:08:50	The_Document	15:08 -!- Mode change [+i] for user The_Document
2018-03-07 18:08:59	nawks	wraeth: eudev/udev. I want someone to look at my logs and debug efforts
2018-03-07 18:09:27	The_Document	I have a tar.bz2 archive which has directories like /opt/blabla and /usr/bin/blabla how do I extract the archive by sending those directories to their appropriate places?
2018-03-07 18:09:30	nawks	it's a usb printer hotplug issue
2018-03-07 18:09:35	+wraeth	nawks: i'll help if i can (once i get some caffeine) but there are also plenty of others in the channel who may be able to help
2018-03-07 18:11:17	+wraeth	The_Document: first, we don't recommend manually installing things to your system unless its in /usr/local - use the package manager instead. having said that, tar has a destination option (-C) you could make use of. people in #gentoo-chat or ##linux, or a search engine, may have more info if you need it
2018-03-07 18:11:59	The_Document	wraeth: It is a paid for cad software, they only have deb, rpm and something called custom install
2018-03-07 18:12:28	+wraeth	The_Document: you could write an ebuild for it yourself
2018-03-07 18:13:11	nawks	wraeth: i went through my debug efforts a few hours ago here and no one jumped in :( I'll get it together and share it with you in a little while then.
2018-03-07 18:13:25	The_Document	wraeth: Im not a programmer
2018-03-07 18:13:39	+wraeth	nawks: yeah, it can be frustrating, but different timezones and audiences and such..
2018-03-07 18:14:01	azarus	The_Document: writing ebuilds is not programming
2018-03-07 18:14:13	hlmjr	Not even kinda/sorta?
2018-03-07 18:14:31	+wraeth	The_Document: and ebuilds for binary packages that basically just extract an archive are pretty straightforward
2018-03-07 18:15:02	azarus	hlmjr: writing recipies for installing software doesn't count as programming for me
2018-03-07 18:15:09	azarus	recipes*
2018-03-07 18:16:25	The_Document	fine I will give it a shot if somebody shows me a guide
2018-03-07 18:16:40	The_Document	I ate too many gummy bears
2018-03-07 18:17:21	The_Document	but its not like Im going to upload the package because its paid for
2018-03-07 18:17:42	▷	kurly tilts his head
2018-03-07 18:18:29	nawks	ahhh, there's someone who enjoys (e)udev debugging
2018-03-07 18:18:42	hlmjr	azarus, fair enough.
2018-03-07 18:18:50	+wraeth	The_Document: https://devmanual.gentoo.org and the many, many examples already on your system. effectively you just need to unpack the files and copy them into ${D} (the install location). no gummy bears needed
2018-03-07 18:23:17	The_Document	wraeth: isn't /opt is were binary packages go?
2018-03-07 18:26:12	tdr	The_Document, they can, or to /usr/local, just don't use / or /usr
2018-03-07 18:28:43	The_Document	I cant do the ebauild because Im pretty sure Im not allowed to upload the archive without granted permission
2018-03-07 18:29:27	tdr	The_Document, theres no need to upload
2018-03-07 18:29:47	tdr	The_Document, just have it in /usr/local/distfiles  and your ebuild with find it
2018-03-07 18:30:04	+kurly	The_Document: who said anything about uploading?
2018-03-07 18:30:30	+kurly	at least learn what is and isn't required before deciding you can't do it
2018-03-07 18:30:48	The_Document	kurly: this SRC_URI=
2018-03-07 18:30:58	+kurly	tdr: /usr/portage/distfiles ?
2018-03-07 18:31:12	tdr	yeah
2018-03-07 18:31:14	The_Document	I always rm * that directory
2018-03-07 18:31:22	tdr	the /usr/portage/distfiles
2018-03-07 18:31:25	+kurly	The_Document: URI doesn't have to be anywhere remote
2018-03-07 18:31:29	+kurly	The_Document: and don't do that.
2018-03-07 18:31:44	tdr	kurly,  mind was sidetracked cleaning a local portage
2018-03-07 18:31:45	+kurly	The_Document: at least use eclean-dist so you're not wasting community resources downloading files you should already have
2018-03-07 18:31:56	The_Document	kurly: oww I see
2018-03-07 18:32:18	+kurly	The_Document: if the file is already in distfiles, SRC_URI isn't used at all
2018-03-07 18:32:50	The_Document	does eclean-dist normally take forever to run?
2018-03-07 18:32:51	+kurly	The_Document: also there's a concept called 'fetch restricted' ... there are non-free programs in the gentoo tree, and it's up to you to provide the distfile.  same thing for your ebuild.
2018-03-07 18:33:29	tdr	The_Document, it can take awhile for it to calculate what an emerge -e @world would do so it knows what it would need to rebuild, so someitmes its not super quick
2018-03-07 18:33:51	+kurly	I don't know, I don't normally watch it; it's definitely not forever because I've run it more than once in my life and it finished :P
2018-03-07 18:33:53	The_Document	haha it said its already clean
2018-03-07 18:34:07	The_Document	kurly: good point
2018-03-07 18:34:16	+kurly	it even has a -f flag to protect fetch-restricted packages (like, say, the one you're talking about)
2018-03-07 18:34:40	The_Document	if I were granted permission to upload were would it go?
2018-03-07 18:34:53	+kurly	who said anything about uploading? :)
2018-03-07 18:35:15	tdr	The_Document, the src uri could literally be any web address
2018-03-07 18:41:38	The_Document	looks pretty straight forward, but Im not making an ebuild unless I can upload the trial version to some repo will ask owner for permission
2018-03-07 18:42:58	tdr	you'd want to test it locally anyway
2018-03-07 18:44:55	The_Document	tdr: it already complaints about tph thread package, need some useflag debugging before I even being writing the ebuild, but once I do I will likely write an ebuild anyways
2018-03-07 18:47:19	Belxjander	where is the rule renaming "eth0" and "wlan0" into this new "wlp4s0" style come from ?
2018-03-07 18:47:32	Belxjander	because I would like to switch it off
2018-03-07 18:49:06	ajeddeloh	It looks like the net-dns/bind-tools package is broken for cross compilation. Specifically --with-ecdsa=[yes,no] needs to be specified when cross compiling. It looks like a patch to fix this existed in the 9.10.2 patch files but wasn't ported to 9.11.x. Relevent part of the patch https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/commit/4a1ce23b27f5aec393ea6a1fa6e7bcc80222a0c8#diff-7b49f2e136e693ca57684d1006d79161L94
2018-03-07 18:49:17	The_Document	Belxjander: Id like to do the same
2018-03-07 18:49:45	+wraeth	The_Document, tdr: SRC_URI could simply be "my-package-1.2.3.tar.bz2" and use RESTRICT="FETCH" - you don't need any remote address whatsoever
2018-03-07 18:50:02	+wraeth	*RESTRICT="fetch"
2018-03-07 18:51:12	tdr	wraeth, neat, i wasnt aware you could use a simple file name
2018-03-07 18:52:09	The_Document	wraeth: can it be SRC_URI="/home/blalba/dapakage" ?
2018-03-07 18:52:40	+wraeth	Belxjander: it's udev that renames interfaces from eth* to en1something2, and there are a few options to undo it - a search on "udev predictable interface names" will help, or i believe adding "net.ifnames=0" to your kernel cmdline still prevents it
2018-03-07 18:52:44	The_Document	wraeth: or does it automaticall look in distfiles?
2018-03-07 18:53:17	+wraeth	The_Document: i'm not sure if a path will work, but a simple file name should, and oyu just put the file in your distfiles directory
2018-03-07 18:53:58	+wraeth	Belxjander: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/
2018-03-07 18:55:01	tdr	yeah the grub way still works
2018-03-07 18:56:45	Belxjander	wraeth: thanks for assuming I web browse on the same machine I IRC with :)
2018-03-07 18:57:24	The_Document	what was the point of moving away from traditional net names anyway?
2018-03-07 18:57:44	+wraeth	Belxjander: i made no such assumption - use whatever device you like. my assumption was that you have network connectivity with which you *can* browse the internet, since you're connected to it :)
2018-03-07 18:58:16	Belxjander	The_Document: no idea...I just recall there was some udev rules that seemed to be missing for setting them which confused me as to where the rename was happening
2018-03-07 18:58:24	+wraeth	The_Document: the eth* device naming scheme was deemed unpredictable, so one based on the logical location of the device in the system hierarchy was implemented
2018-03-07 18:59:30	+wraeth	for example, [en][pN][sN] translates to [ethernet network][port N][slot N]
2018-03-07 18:59:53	+wraeth	rather than "ethN" for "the Nth ethernet device found during device enumeration"
2018-03-07 19:01:11	The_Document	wonder if it added a layer of secerity since netnames are no longer traditinally named as they use to be
2018-03-07 19:01:37	+wraeth	potentially, but only through obscurity
2018-03-07 19:01:42	Belxjander	weraeth: weird/...I always had a udev rule listing a MAC = ethN/wlanN arrangement I used which meant every time a particular device was present/missing the particular interface it was named was static,  so the numeric ordering was non-linear in being *installed* order and NOT "enumeration order"
2018-03-07 19:02:20	Belxjander	Thev00d00: not really...the new names are just a little more awkward to type and show up as an enumeration list for me anyway
2018-03-07 19:02:56	+wraeth	Belxjander: sure, explicitly defining your interface names avoids the issue, but it requires that one *does* explicitly define their interface names
2018-03-07 19:03:00	▷	Belxjander is just annoyed the whole "it will be named this" *policy*decision* was taken from configs and pushed to code...
2018-03-07 19:03:06	+wraeth	either way, that's what it is, that's why it is, and that's how to change it
2018-03-07 19:04:10	+wraeth	Belxjander: also, if you have udev rules explicitly assigning your devices interface names, i would have thought that would take precedence over automatically assigned names, predictable or not..
2018-03-07 19:05:05	tdr	Belxjander, it was not a gentoo choice to change the naming, it was done across linux

2018-03-07 19:31:09	nawks	djdunn: that's not a lot to go on
2018-03-07 19:32:27	djdunn	ps2 keyboard works in the VT's
2018-03-07 19:32:33	djdunn	it doesnt show up in udev
2018-03-07 19:32:53	djdunn	and doesnt show up in X, which probably has to do with not showing up in udev
2018-03-07 19:32:59	nawks	how do you know it "doesn't show up"?
2018-03-07 19:34:14	Kelsar	djdunn: ps2 is not a "hotplug" thing, it is there or it is not. I guess /dev/psaux is there?
2018-03-07 19:34:29	Kelsar	djdunn: what did you set INPUT_DEVICES too?
2018-03-07 19:34:34	nawks	The_Document: add libdrm to your emerge list of pkgs
2018-03-07 19:34:45	djdunn	i have a /dev/psaux
2018-03-07 19:34:48	djdunn	is that the keyboard?
2018-03-07 19:34:55	Kelsar	djdunn: yes
2018-03-07 19:34:58	Kelsar	if it is ps2
2018-03-07 19:35:08	djdunn	i have input devices set as...
2018-03-07 19:35:17	Kelsar	The_Document: seems you changed ABI flags, do world update 1st
2018-03-07 19:35:27	djdunn	set as ="evdev"
2018-03-07 19:35:40	Kelsar	The_Document: also you likely want to add -1 to your command
2018-03-07 19:36:09	Kelsar	djdunn: what does xorg.log show?
2018-03-07 19:37:37	djdunn	Kelsar: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/9uQ15IyGbTunNkfSkPEj/
2018-03-07 19:38:30	Kelsar	djdunn: emerge --info that log says your INPUT_DEVICES is set different too
2018-03-07 19:39:05	djdunn	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/s40tlZcFw4mWj6bkVs69/
2018-03-07 19:40:23	Kelsar	right now it uses libinput, did you change those flags recently?
2018-03-07 19:40:48	djdunn	ive been swapping them all around for the past 2 days
2018-03-07 19:41:09	Kelsar	emerge -avuDN world && emerge -avc
2018-03-07 19:41:11	Kelsar	done?
2018-03-07 19:41:53	djdunn	yeah kde plasma seems to want both libinput and evdev
2018-03-07 19:42:10	nawks	djdunn: ummm no, plasma doesn't care
2018-03-07 19:42:20	Kelsar	djdunn: unlikely
2018-03-07 19:42:33	tdr	theres a libiput flag on a kde package probably
2018-03-07 19:42:36	The_Document	Kelsar: that was no issue, this is https://paste.pound-python.org/show/HIjqWu1Qrf3ru44ABza9/
2018-03-07 19:42:37	djdunn	plasma-desktop depends on xf86-input-libinput
2018-03-07 19:42:56	djdunn	set by mouse useflag thats set by the profile
2018-03-07 19:42:57	tdr	djdunn, qlist -ICU | grep libinput
2018-03-07 19:43:27	Kelsar	The_Document: some binary package missing a library, maybe even the 32bit one ldd on that binary should tell
2018-03-07 19:43:47	djdunn	tdr: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/hJuwbpCgmUxfL1b7C9dR/
2018-03-07 19:45:09	Kelsar	djdunn: indirect through wayland... makes sense sadly
2018-03-07 19:46:03	nawks	ok, so use libinput and exclude evdev, right?
2018-03-07 19:46:14	nawks	libinput obsoletes evdev
2018-03-07 19:46:27	Kelsar	djdunn: Which libinput version?
2018-03-07 19:46:43	Kelsar	nawks: nah, does not matter, you can have booth installed
2018-03-07 19:46:52	djdunn	dev-libs/libinput-1.10.1
2018-03-07 19:46:57	nawks	but why would you?
2018-03-07 19:47:17	Kelsar	because not everything works correct with libinput right now
2018-03-07 19:47:34	Kelsar	djdunn: maybe try another version
2018-03-07 19:47:57	Kelsar	djdunn: sorry, hadn't a PS/2 Keyboard for a very long time
2018-03-07 19:48:08	djdunn	i thought /dev/psaux was for a ps2 mouse
2018-03-07 19:48:51	nawks	i thought /dev/psmouse was for a ps2 mouse. you should have that device too anyway
2018-03-07 19:49:10	Kelsar	djdunn: but your keyboard works on tty, so kernel side should be fine
2018-03-07 19:49:16	djdunn	yeah
2018-03-07 19:49:34	djdunn	either libinput or evdev they both load the mouse, but dont even look for keyboard
2018-03-07 19:49:50	The_Document	Kelsar: I have no idea what to do about that missing lib, I alread emerged npth and dev-libs/libpthread-stubs with 32bit support
2018-03-07 19:50:09	Kelsar	The_Document: how did you install that package?
2018-03-07 19:50:22	The_Document	Kelsar: its paid for software it is in /opt
2018-03-07 19:50:56	Kelsar	Well, ask the support. ldd might tell you where it expects those libs and which version
2018-03-07 19:51:33	djdunn	i dont see anything for the keyboard in /dev/input/by-path
2018-03-07 19:51:50	Kelsar	afaik won't be there
2018-03-07 19:51:57	josef64	djdunn: if you want the evdev driver, then set a Symlink in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf -> /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf
2018-03-07 19:52:20	nawks	The_Document: npth installs libnpth.so -- your app wants libpth.so
2018-03-07 19:52:22	djdunn	josef64: tried that it doesnt load the keyboard

2018-03-07 19:56:24	djdunn	but that stopped working
2018-03-07 19:57:03	josef64	djdunn: Hm, try the stable xorg-server --> emerge -av1 =xorg-server-1.19.5-r1 @x11-module-rebuild
2018-03-07 19:58:39	djdunn	josef64: happens with 1.19.5 also
2018-03-07 19:59:05	The_Document	nawks: I think they are the same thing
2018-03-07 19:59:40	nawks	The_Document: you could try making a symlink... libpth.so --> libnpth.so
2018-03-07 19:59:56	nawks	this is soooo old though... it might bomb
2018-03-07 20:02:41	The_Document	nawks: lol
2018-03-07 20:02:46	The_Document	nawks: it works after symlinking
2018-03-07 20:03:06	nawks	w00t!
2018-03-07 20:03:41	nawks	that's good to know
2018-03-07 20:08:07	guest1222	hi guys, I just borked my system pretty bad. I added the gentoo-snappy overlay, went to emerge snapd, saw the notice about my profile being out of date and to upgrade to the 17.0 profile. So I did, without looking at the news notice about it. And now all of my emerges fail on the configure phase, no matter what profile I'm in.
2018-03-07 20:08:36	The_Document	nawks: just can't activate it for some reason
2018-03-07 20:08:40	The_Document	its a licensing issue
2018-03-07 20:13:23	nawks	guest1222: try reselecting gcc with gcc-config, then 'ldconfig'
2018-03-07 20:14:29	nawks	guest1222: maybe reselect binutils-config too
2018-03-07 20:15:17	+wraeth	you should rebuild libtool after selecting a new gcc as well, at least; though there may be more required depending on the version jump (see news items)
2018-03-07 20:15:41	dansan	Can anybody recommend a terminal emulator (for serial ports) other than minicom (which reportedly has problems with u-boot)?  A command line one woudl be ncie
2018-03-07 20:16:18	nawks	wraeth: don't have to select a 'new' gcc. gcc-config will rewrite the needed symlinks into the new lib dir structure
2018-03-07 20:16:38	Kelsar	dansan: screen
2018-03-07 20:16:44	audiodef	If a package says it can't find "dot" while compiling and fails, what is it referring to that's in Portage?
2018-03-07 20:16:57	dansan	Kelsar: wow, that does serial terminals too?
2018-03-07 20:17:04	Kelsar	dansan: yes
2018-03-07 20:17:15	dansan	Kelsar: awesome, thanks!
2018-03-07 20:17:54	dansan	It could really benefit me to learn and get used to it.  I can end up with 15-20 tabs open in my (shell-prompt) terminal program
2018-03-07 20:19:56	The_Document	now another issue: /opt/bricsys/bricscad/v17/bricscad: symbol lookup error: /opt/bricsys/bricscad/v17/libcadapp.so: undefined symbol: pth_init
2018-03-07 20:20:45	+wraeth	The_Document: you should take it up with the software provider - being a binary package (and one not in portage) there's very little we can do
2018-03-07 20:21:38	gyroninja	The_Document: That's from your symlink hack
2018-03-07 20:21:42	gyroninja	(probably)
2018-03-07 20:24:39	guest1222	nawks: I did gcc-config: [6] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-6.4.0 *, binutils-config: only has [1] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-2.25.1 *, and does ldconfig produce any output?
2018-03-07 20:25:25	nawks	no it does not
2018-03-07 20:26:07	nawks	it rebuilds /etc/ld.so.cache
2018-03-07 20:26:42	guest1222	alright, I just tried to rebuild libtool: emerge -1avt libtool and it failed with

2018-03-07 20:29:53	dansan	Kelsar: So to send an "escape" in screen, do I press "escape"? :)
2018-03-07 20:30:01	dansan	Kelsar: Or is this something you have to configure first?
2018-03-07 20:30:15	+kurly	guest1222: I think you're in the wrong channel, this is #gentoo
2018-03-07 20:30:29	+wraeth	audiodef: at a guess (without seeing any output, hint hint) i'd guess it means it cant find the present working directory - did you try running emerge from within /var/tmp/portage somewhere?
2018-03-07 20:30:34	dansan	Something in the creeky recesses of my mind says something about ctrl-k
2018-03-07 20:30:37	+kurly	guest1222: if I had to guess, I'd say you have bad CFLAGS
2018-03-07 20:31:01	Irishluck83	alright kurly i'm back to try to fix my emerge problem
2018-03-07 20:31:43	guest1222	hmm, I'll try and examine my cflags

2018-03-07 20:32:12	[Gentoo]	guest1222: comment out cflags ldflags etc in make.conf
2018-03-07 20:32:23	nawks	guest1222: may also need '. /etc/profile' after doing gcc-config
2018-03-07 20:32:24	[Gentoo]	quickest way to test
2018-03-07 20:32:43	shaggymane	anyone know how to primus run WorldofWarcraft in wine? .. I cant seem to get it to work correct.. maybe my command line skills lake
2018-03-07 20:32:46	dansan	ah hah! it's just the scape key!
2018-03-07 20:33:44	nawks	guest1222: do you have /lib ?
2018-03-07 20:34:06	guest1222	nawks: yes
2018-03-07 20:34:15	+kurly	guest1222: the other problem is that we can't support gentoo derivatives in #gentoo, please refer to the channel policy
2018-03-07 20:34:34	guest1222	kurly: that's fair. I'm pretty sure my problem is a portage problem though
2018-03-07 20:35:25	+kurly	maybe it is; if you can reproduce it on gentoo, we can take a look
2018-03-07 20:35:38	guest1222	sure thing
2018-03-07 20:35:42	guest1222	I'll keep poking around
2018-03-07 20:35:49	+kurly	yeah, I hope you get it figured out though! :)

2018-03-07 21:05:08	guytheguy	That's the thing though, I ordered a U.S. keybaord from Purism... I'll check their sight to see if they recommend a particular keymap

2018-03-07 21:06:53	guytheguy	Is "QWERTY" a specific type of keyboard or are you asking me if my keyboard is Dvorak? Which it's not
2018-03-07 21:06:56	audiodef	wraeth: Sure, open beta been going on for a while, so feedback welcome.

2018-03-07 21:18:19	koz_	gyroninja: So mask to be sure? How would I ask it to mask 'xorg-server-1.19.99.901 and any r of that'?

2018-03-07 21:28:54	guytheguy	It's not the gui ;p

2018-03-07 21:59:05	+grknight	hmm.. /dev/input doesn't show ps/2 paths, but the devices should show there even if they don't match
2018-03-07 21:59:26	djdunn	right
2018-03-07 21:59:38	djdunn	it should show two keyboards

2018-03-07 22:32:41	nawks	so is ps2
2018-03-07 22:32:49	+kurly	unless you're doing something like trying to do without evdev and without libinput and without any sort of udev
2018-03-07 22:33:03	nawks	so his libinput isn't seeing it
2018-03-07 22:33:33	korans	where are sets like system defined ?

2018-03-07 22:38:14	korans	well man portage says I'll need too refer to html docs which I'm downloading now. I just wanted to remove ssh which says it's required by the system set

2018-03-07 22:38:56	korans	also is it possible to build parts of a ebuild such as those which have make options for specific parts like docs
2018-03-07 22:38:59	+kurly	korans: I already told you the answer: packages
2018-03-07 22:39:32	djdunn	nawks thats in /sys/devices

2018-03-07 22:50:29	nawks	guytheguy: even 1GB of swap becomes excruciatingly slow when much of it is actively used

2018-03-07 22:52:05	+kurly	nawks: if you're using swap to cover for lack of RAM, yeah.  that's not the only use for swap.
2018-03-07 22:52:06	+wraeth	don't close the lid :)
2018-03-07 22:52:38	aesycos	lmao thank wraeth
2018-03-07 22:52:40	nawks	for hibernation? hmmm... how long it take to copy 8GB or more of ram to HD?
2018-03-07 22:53:43	+kurly	nawks: that's not the only use for swap either: the kernel is smarter than you think at memory management
2018-03-07 22:54:48	nawks	aesycos: there are some scripts to disable touchpad when lid closes. not sure if they'll help your issue. depends on if it is freezing instantly or freezing because touchpad sending endless crazy input to desktop
2018-03-07 22:55:31	aesycos	freezes instantly
2018-03-07 22:55:41	aesycos	ive tried disable and enable with xinput
2018-03-07 22:55:53	aesycos	didnt do squat
2018-03-07 22:56:08	+kurly	nawks: while this page isn't swap-specific, it provides some insight into the various uses for RAM/swap:  https://www.linuxatemyram.com/
2018-03-07 22:56:14	nawks	kurly: Swap:       2097148           0     2097148
2018-03-07 22:58:32	nawks	kurly: it says that swap isn't used for caching (of course)
2018-03-07 22:58:36	+kurly	nawks: not using swap isn't abnormal; using swap (appropriately) isn't abnormal
2018-03-07 22:59:03	+kurly	nawks: https://haydenjames.io/linux-performance-almost-always-add-swap-space/ is another thing worth reading, despite the ads all over the layout
2018-03-07 22:59:49	nawks	i know kernel is smart enough to swap out a process that has been asleep for a long time. those thing usually don't involve large amounts of mem though
2018-03-07 23:00:09	+kurly	as always, it's something that's usually better to have and not need than need and not have
2018-03-07 23:00:44	nawks	downside is that it can get into swap-hole instead of just ooming something
2018-03-07 23:02:17	nawks	yes it can free a few hundred meg of ram. that's about it
2018-03-07 23:03:06	nawks	"With swap disabled, performance issues become noticeable very fast and the OOM killer may get you!"
2018-03-07 23:03:51	nawks	plenty I've times I've regretted that it spirals into near-freeze of endless swapping instead of oom killing
2018-03-07 23:04:05	+kurly	k
2018-03-07 23:04:32	nawks	eventually it does freeze, or oom finally kicks in if lucky
2018-03-07 23:04:47	aesycos	is there anything in my kernel that might screw up my touchpad? or some log or debug msg i can check for whats going on?
2018-03-07 23:07:00	djdunn	awesome now kde's window manager isnt loading
2018-03-07 23:07:08	nawks	kurly: my point anyway was that one should have a GB or 2 of swap, not 8GB to match 8GB of ram. that 1:1 guideline was from days when we had 64MB of ram and having 64MB (or 128MB) of swap with it made sense
2018-03-07 23:08:52	+kurly	nawks: I don't recall specifying a guideline. *shrug*
2018-03-07 23:13:44	djdunn	are there kde logs anywhere?
2018-03-07 23:15:48	nawks	djdunn: there's sddm log
2018-03-07 23:16:18	+wraeth	if you use systemd, there may be relevant things in the journal
2018-03-07 23:16:46	djdunn	yeah openrc here
2018-03-07 23:16:51	djdunn	and kwin just doesnt start
2018-03-07 23:16:59	djdunn	dont get a hey kwin crashed message either
2018-03-07 23:17:04	+wraeth	could also try ~/.xsession-errors
2018-03-07 23:17:11	djdunn	constant problems
2018-03-07 23:18:25	nawks	you need good working opengl for kwin to be happy
2018-03-07 23:18:35	djdunn	i have a good working opengl
2018-03-07 23:20:18	djdunn	i hope so...
2018-03-07 23:20:38	djdunn	kwin was working i restarted xdm then its not
2018-03-07 23:21:21	djdunn	... i bet i died and went to hell
2018-03-07 23:23:37	djdunn	yeah opengl is fine
2018-03-07 23:24:22	nawks	djdunn: how did you break sddm?
2018-03-07 23:25:08	nawks	maybe you just need a big 'ol emerge -e and a two-day nap
2018-03-07 23:29:04	djdunn	nawks: sddm with elogind wont work for me higher than version 0.15
2018-03-07 23:29:38	nawks	yeah don't build it with elogind
2018-03-07 23:29:43	djdunn	but .15 lets me login and it loads kde, it was loading just fine but now the list 3x-4x times ive tried loging in it doesnt start kwin
2018-03-07 23:30:25	djdunn	i just reinstalled the entire system yesterday from a stage 3
2018-03-07 23:32:20	djdunn	ok i rebuild back to latest xorg in the tree and the latest libinput
2018-03-07 23:32:37	djdunn	and why do i have to unplug my usb stuff and plug it back in before it works when i reboot
2018-03-07 23:34:28	nawks	you mean it won't boot with it plugged in?
2018-03-07 23:34:43	djdunn	it boots it works
2018-03-07 23:35:01	djdunn	i load sddm and no keyboard and no mouse movement till i replug them
2018-03-07 23:36:03	nawks	i don't know. maybe more evdev/libinput carp?
2018-03-07 23:37:19	djdunn	is it wrong to say i miss hal?
2018-03-07 23:37:45	nawks	i'm sorry dave
2018-03-07 23:37:59	djdunn	>_<
2018-03-07 23:38:03	djdunn	maybe its time to start drinking
2018-03-07 23:38:51	nawks	ok, enjoy. i'm done computing too
2018-03-07 23:38:55	nawks	nn o/
2018-03-07 23:39:27	djdunn	im starting to think libinput is garbage
2018-03-07 23:39:57	nawks	evdev should work
2018-03-07 23:40:11	nawks	but it needs events too I guess
2018-03-07 23:40:23	+kurly	djdunn: fwiw (which isn't much), I never made the switch from evdev to libinput
2018-03-07 23:40:25	djdunn	yeah it got all tied together recently
2018-03-07 23:40:56	nawks	prob should get tdr to go through your kernel config tomorrow
2018-03-07 23:40:56	djdunn	atm right now i think i can get a ps2/usb connector easy
2018-03-07 23:40:59	tdr	libinput works easy for the hardware it works will
2018-03-07 23:41:03	tdr	well
2018-03-07 23:41:15	nawks	ahahaha, speak of the devil!
2018-03-07 23:41:26	djdunn	and i can deal with unplugging replugging usb every reboot which i never do
2018-03-07 23:41:46	tdr	djdunn, which kernel are you on?
2018-03-07 23:41:48	nawks	djdunn: udev or eudev?
2018-03-07 23:41:52	djdunn	eudev
2018-03-07 23:42:40	gallantz	lately it seems something is wrong with my toolchain. building most haskell packages complains about either using "-r and -pie" at the same time, some other haskell packages complain about linking with anything (the linker recommends recompiling with -fPIC)
2018-03-07 23:42:54	+kurly	there should be no substantial difference between udev and eudev, other than what tarball they come from
2018-03-07 23:43:00	gallantz	at first I thought it was just haskell being wonky but lately the crystal compiler is having linking issues as well
2018-03-07 23:43:37	gallantz	it tries to link against common libraries (-lm, -phtread, -lc) and I get "skipping incompatible /usr/lib/.....so"
2018-03-07 23:43:52	nawks	gallantz: upgraded to gcc 6 or 7?
2018-03-07 23:44:01	nawks	and profile 17.0?
2018-03-07 23:44:12	gallantz	Not sure if this is due to the new 17/17.1 migrations but I doubt because I was using hardened so should have had PIE on since creating this system
2018-03-07 23:44:22	+kurly	gallantz: I can't help with haskell, but the bottom of every failed emerge tells you what to tell us, and you can use wgetpaste to do it (see the -c/-i/-I options, or just use it to paste a file!)
2018-03-07 23:44:43	+kurly	at a minimum, 'wgetpaste -I' will show your emerge --info
2018-03-07 23:45:08	gallantz	kurly: it even happens outside of portage. It feels like some libraries need to be rebuilt. Do you want an emerge --info paste anyway?
2018-03-07 23:45:17	gallantz	nawks: yes. 17.1, gcc-7.3.0
2018-03-07 23:45:20	+kurly	we can only help with stuff in portage
2018-03-07 23:45:29	+kurly	and 17.1 is still kinda experimental
2018-03-07 23:45:40	nawks	gallantz: some pie pic defaults flipped a few times last year, caused some confusion
2018-03-07 23:45:45	+kurly	did you follow the news items to upgrade to 17.0 and 17.1?
2018-03-07 23:45:45	djdunn	oh comeon :( and super mario bros supershow doesnt have the legend of zelda cartoon
2018-03-07 23:45:50	djdunn	on nextflix
2018-03-07 23:45:51	gallantz	kurly: definitely did
2018-03-07 23:45:57	+kurly	gallantz: good, good.
2018-03-07 23:46:02	+kurly	djdunn: eh, wrong channel :)
2018-03-07 23:46:23	gallantz	nawks: is there something that needs to be rebuilt once things settle down?
2018-03-07 23:46:29	djdunn	yeah probably
2018-03-07 23:47:22	nawks	gallantz: any libs not built with pic/pie, obviously
2018-03-07 23:47:45	gallantz	nawks: can I query that somehow
2018-03-07 23:48:37	tdr	djdunn, do you want your kernel looked at?
2018-03-07 23:48:46	gallantz	a lot of my messages are from things in glibc, but I know that was rebuilt.
2018-03-07 23:48:56	djdunn	tdr: yeah sure
2018-03-07 23:49:03	tdr	djdunn, what version?
2018-03-07 23:49:12	djdunn	running 4.14.24 atm
2018-03-07 23:49:50	tdr	djdunn, ok show me these:  wgetpaste -c "lspci -k ; lsusb ; dmesg" ; wgetpaste /usr/src/linux/.config
2018-03-07 23:49:52	djdunn	tdr: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/AVvUfJi2ex4RZiJiRZee/
2018-03-07 23:51:58	The_Document	not good
2018-03-07 23:54:32	nawks	gallantz: app-admin/hardening-check
2018-03-07 23:55:16	Tom23	Hi I need some opencl help with my Radeon HD 6670 card. I pulled down dev-libs/amdgpu-pro-opencl 17.50.511655 but it is giving me segfault libamdocl64.so did I pull in the wrong package?
2018-03-07 23:55:36	djdunn	tdr: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/hSMCPqyXxgtlIdPsR51c/
2018-03-07 23:56:46	djdunn	tdr: that didnt do something right
2018-03-07 23:56:53	nawks	gallantz: maybe emerge -e is easiest if you have time. are you sure you successfully 'unsymlink-lib --finish' for 17.1 upgrade?
2018-03-07 23:57:38	nawks	may want to check around a bit for stale libs
2018-03-07 23:57:55	tdr	djdunn, hrm ... do you have lspci and lsusb commands?
2018-03-07 23:58:04	gallantz	looks like hardening-check only scans ELFs not .so?
2018-03-07 23:58:09	djdunn	yeah
2018-03-07 23:58:12	gallantz	nawks: I did run that
2018-03-07 23:58:12	djdunn	its there in that first link
2018-03-07 23:58:19	djdunn	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/hSMCPqyXxgtlIdPsR51c/
2018-03-07 23:58:26	djdunn	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/iyoyPjVasMRsk5WKPsI4/
2018-03-07 23:58:55	gallantz	nawks: kinda wanna void running emerge -e on a dual core laptop with 1500 packages ;)
2018-03-07 23:58:57	tdr	djdunn, ok got it https://paste.pound-python.org/show/hSMCPqyXxgtlIdPsR51c/ works
2018-03-08 00:04:02	Tom23	I'm just looking more so for someone to point me in the right direction then to full out help me. gentoo wiki is not helping me.
2018-03-08 00:09:34	Tom23	so no one can give me a hint as to how i should go about fixing this?
2018-03-08 00:10:17	+kurly	your problem is unclear; wgetpaste can help fix that
2018-03-08 00:13:21	tdr	Dj_Dexter, what kind of kb + mouse connectors do you have?
2018-03-08 00:13:26	tdr	djdunn, ^^
2018-03-08 00:13:50	tdr	nm, usb keyboard, logitech mouse
2018-03-08 00:14:20	djdunn	yeah
2018-03-08 00:14:25	djdunn	and ps2 keyboard
2018-03-08 00:14:58	tdr	ok found one issue with ps2 so gimme a couple mins and I'll paste ya a new config
2018-03-08 00:15:21	djdunn	problems with ps?
2018-03-08 00:15:24	djdunn	ps/2?
2018-03-08 00:15:42	Kietelaar	Chromium seems to be using clang now to compile instead of GCC but this doesn't seem to use distcc properly any more at least on my system, any way to fix this?
2018-03-08 00:17:20	+kurly	Kietelaar: potential workaround, build a binary package in a chroot on another machine
2018-03-08 00:18:03	smolboye	does anyone here run gentoo on macbook pro
2018-03-08 00:19:14	notashark	smolboye: if they do I would love to know
2018-03-08 00:19:45	smolboye	i mean i do
2018-03-08 00:19:51	smolboye	but it runs p hot
2018-03-08 00:20:04	smolboye	wanted to ask if someone runs it and its cool for them
2018-03-08 00:20:26	smolboye	idk if its my macbook or some misconfig
2018-03-08 00:20:32	gyroninja	smolboye: You'll probably need to be more specific with the model
2018-03-08 00:20:43	smolboye	mbp mid 2012 13"
2018-03-08 00:20:57	smolboye	but i dont think that should make any difference
2018-03-08 00:21:07	smolboye	unless its a new macbook or a really old one
2018-03-08 00:21:16	smolboye	cause all the middle ones have similar specs
2018-03-08 00:21:53	gyroninja	I think the last few years have had really bad cooling. I could be completely wrong though as I don't pay attential to apple hardware, nor laptop hardware
2018-03-08 00:22:07	smolboye	mine isn't new though
2018-03-08 00:22:25	smolboye	i mean it runs cool on macOS but not on gentoo idk why
2018-03-08 00:22:41	smolboye	would appreciate if anyone using macbook helps me
2018-03-08 00:22:42	smolboye	:)
2018-03-08 00:24:09	gyroninja	Maybe it is designed for downclocking the cpu for when it gets too hot
2018-03-08 00:25:00	gyroninja	and your setup isn't currently doing it
2018-03-08 00:27:02	smolboye	yeah im waiting for someone to turn up
2018-03-08 00:27:26	smolboye	what are the chances of me being the only one running gentoo on a mbp 2012
2018-03-08 00:27:27	⚡	day__ is now known as day
2018-03-08 00:27:40	djdunn	tdr: ok
2018-03-08 00:28:52	username234	smolboye: not great, but I haven't heard of too many users putting Gentoo on macs.
2018-03-08 00:31:59	kerframil	smolboye: I don't use Linux on Macbooks, but make sure that the intel_pstate driver is enabled. you may also be interested in this: https://github.com/dgraziotin/mbpfan.
