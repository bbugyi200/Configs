2018-03-06 02:04:54	eyJhb	Hey, do you use weechat-vimode? I can see that you have the latest commit for it :)
2018-03-06 02:05:49	bbugyi200	Yeah. I just started using it, weechat, and IRC in general though very recently.
2018-03-06 02:06:40	eyJhb	Currently using HexChat, and it's killing me, that I need to use the mouse so often... - Would you recommend doing it? 
2018-03-06 02:06:57	eyJhb	Also considering irssi with some vimode - but it was last updated 4-5 years ago
2018-03-06 02:07:58	bbugyi200	If you use vim a lot then definitely. Its got pretty intuitive behavior.
2018-03-06 02:08:41	bbugyi200	I'd also recommend Vimium for google-chrome (if you use chrome). Then you can throw that mouse away. :)
2018-03-06 02:09:20	eyJhb	I use it daily, so I hoped that it would be very intuitive... - I actually switched to Surfing Keys for google-chrome; seems to work better 
2018-03-06 02:12:35	bbugyi200	Oh cool. I've never heard of that. I'm gonna definitely check that out now.
2018-03-06 02:13:10	bbugyi200	Ever tried Vimium? Why do you think Surfingkeys works better?
2018-03-06 02:14:27	eyJhb	For one thing, when you use the "f" key, then the hints is only for eg. the left hand - very awesome :p
2018-03-06 02:21:38	eyJhb	I have a ergodox-ez, so it's very nice, that I can use one hand to surf. And generally it just seems more fluid when using it. - but my goal will be to use qutebrowser
2018-03-06 02:22:50	bbugyi200	I just watched the video for it. It looks sick! I'm definitely going to try it!
2018-03-06 02:25:22	eyJhb	SurfingKeys or Qutebrowser? :p
2018-03-06 02:26:51	bbugyi200	That keyboard looks like the future.
2018-03-06 02:27:22	bbugyi200	Both now that I looked up Qutebrowser.
2018-03-06 02:28:29	eyJhb	It's quite awesome, especially if you come fron a country without all kinds of special characters (æøå)... I really enjoy it ! - One of the bad things about it, is that you don't have all those useless keys anymore
2018-03-06 02:28:48	eyJhb	So programs like weechat, that uses those keys, don't work that well -> why I want vim shortcuts instead 
2018-03-06 02:40:00	bbugyi200	I'm heading to bed. Let me know if you have any problems with weechat-vim. It's pretty full featured, and I found it really easy to extend. (I was only using it for like 2 hours before I made my first contribution.)
2018-03-06 02:44:10	eyJhb	Cheers, I will do that! :) - Just started my day - 8.43 am
2018-03-06 02:45:21	bbugyi200	Ha! I'm in New Jersey, USA (6 hours behind you). Nice talking to you.
2018-03-06 02:45:40	eyJhb	That's a late night then ;) - You too!
