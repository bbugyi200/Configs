2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_;

2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus

2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_;

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack*

2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_;

2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional

2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack*

2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack*

2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack*

2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.

2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over.

2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_;

2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.

One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over.

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan.

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_;

2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]

2017-09-17 21:25:09	jamie	food for thought from WHACK hackcon friend:
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Host workshops before the hackathon. Could be an intro HTML/CSS type workshop. Bonus points if the people hosting the workshop are women. You should totally check out the GitHub Campus Experts program and MLH's local host courses. It gives participants who may feel like "they're not good enough" to have solid skills going in.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- Advertise outside the computer science majors. Does your CS program have a diversity issue? If so, do you want your hackathon demographic to reflect your CS program's demographic? Try advertising outside the major. We've seen really good hacks come from teams with non-CS majors, and it'll help enforce that hackathons are for all.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		- On that note, you could host an "ideathon" type event before the hackathon where non-STEM majors and STEM majors can come together and ideate. Helps bring in non-STEM majors and helps people who may not feel like they know what they're doing come into the hackathon with a game plan. It's also a lot more comfortable imo to attend hackathons and hack with a friend group, so a "let's get together and talk about ideas" informal event could be a good way to help people form teams.
2017-09-17 21:25:09		
2017-09-17 21:25:09		Another thing that WHACK has maintained is a 3:1 hacker to mentor ratio. One of my worst hackathon experience was a hackathon when I ended up on a team that ended up dismissing me because I didn't know how to use a specific framework. They didn't straight up cut me out but they stopped including me in their discussions. Having a ton of support and really setting the tone of "there's no such thing as a stupid question" and "it's okay if you've never used JavaScript before, let's work through this together" is really nice imo. I definitely have more fun at hackathons where there isn't so much of a pressure to win things and it's more about learning new skills that I can work with even after the hackathon is over. [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 21:34:17	brandonyu	Yea ive been saying we should have prehackru workshops,i think its a good idea to get beginners excited [:heart_eyes:1] 
2017-09-17 21:46:51	tanya	3:1 hacker to mentor would mean 200 mentors for us ;_; 
2017-09-17 21:47:32	jamie	the dream ;______; 
2017-09-17 22:37:05	srihari.shankar1	I do like the 3:1 thing pennapps used to do that 
2017-09-17 22:37:14	srihari.shankar1	Or it was optional  
2017-09-17 22:38:22	jamie	can you explain a little more @srihari.shankar1? 
2017-09-17 22:54:14	srihari.shankar1	So pennapps had an option to have a mentor as part of your team and the mentor would help back 
2017-09-17 22:54:38	srihari.shankar1	They called them hacker gurus 
2017-09-17 22:54:45	srihari.shankar1	Hack* 
2017-09-17 22:55:06	jamie	Oooh yeah. @tanya @azoam @nemo  
2017-09-17 22:55:19	jamie	Thoughts on implmenting that? ^ [:heart:3] 
2017-09-17 23:12:22	srihari.shankar1	It does have isssues tho ( mainly needing dedicated mentors cause from my understanding the mentor would hack with the team) and if the team decides to leave midway through I imagine it would be kinda annoying from a mentors perspective  
2017-09-17 23:53:25	rigved	Can we ask wtf pennapps does that their organizers/mentors/volunteers are sooo dedicated 
2017-09-18 00:05:00	srihari.shankar1	If we allow the mentors to win awards then guru idea might work as it's big incentive  
2017-09-18 10:33:18	guest-timotius	I was a hacker guru at pennapps before and there really isn't anything that holds the team together more than a normal team. 
2017-09-18 10:34:30	guest-timotius	I think the only special was that they had a hacker guru meeting at the start of the event to explain what we're supposed to do and a prize at the end for the best hacker guru-led team [:open_mouth:2]
