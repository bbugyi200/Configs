2018-03-04 01:35:41	_habnabit	FrostRobin1, can you show some code?
2018-03-04 01:35:49	FrostRobin1	https://ghostbin.com/paste/bmsrq
2018-03-04 01:35:51	minn	self.praise is a method that returns a string; self.name is a string attribute
2018-03-04 01:36:21	_habnabit	FrostRobin1, ok? but that code doesn't have 'name.praise' in it
2018-03-04 01:36:26	minn	(of the class)
2018-03-04 01:36:43	FrostRobin1	_habnabit, I changed it because it wasnt working
2018-03-04 01:36:59	FrostRobin1	minn, what would name.praise() do in this case? if possible
2018-03-04 01:37:44	minn	name is not an object with a praise method (it is a string)

2018-03-04 01:39:16	FrostRobin1	minn, _habnabit, I understand now lol.  the idea of "self" was just confusing but I am starting to understand it more now

2018-03-04 06:37:14	acresearch	People i am having a problem with vector rotation, this script seems to "almost" work. it does rotate a vector, but not correctly. i try to rotate by 90 degree but it only rotates by 5 degree, but it plots the vectors as if they got rotated by 90 degree, confused? also the magnitude of the rotated vector changes, which according to the math it should not, anyone can help me understand what is wrong?

2018-03-04 06:39:40	sh0ne	Is it better to store last used value of some data (i.e. an IP address) in environment variable (and update it when it changes) or it's better to write it to a file then update it when it is changed (I will check for new IP every 10 minutes or so)? I am suspecting that opening a file and reading/changing it every time might be slower then doing the same to environment variable. Any suggestions?

2018-03-04 10:01:32	saberu	dmartins, I'm pretty new to Python so sorry to ask such a basic question. But when I put an If statement inside an elif block it says unexpected indent. If I put it outside the block (not indented) i don't get the error but then I don't have the expected behaviour

Using pip to install it is taking too long, and I think because its building code on the raspberry pi. Would I be able to move the install from "sudo apt-get.." to my virtualenv somehow?

2018-03-04 11:33:39	altendky	:[  zip are ignored by default...  i guess scrapers don't hit tarballs as often.
2018-03-04 11:34:13	nanonyme	altendky, isn't a zip a deadend anyhow when scraping?
2018-03-04 11:34:33	altendky	nanonyme: wouldn't a tarball be the same?  and both might be a target
2018-03-04 11:34:45	nanonyme	They would both be deadends, yes
2018-03-04 11:34:55	nanonyme	But yeah, depends on what you're trying to do
2018-03-04 11:35:13	nanonyme	I guess it would be pragmatic to still report all deadends
2018-03-04 11:35:34	altendky	nanonyme: yeah, being my first scraping i won't judge if archives should be ignored or not.  just noting inconsistency.  in my case i'm taking a stab at creating a repo from the pyqt5 snapshots.
2018-03-04 11:35:42	altendky	so zip and tarball are of interest

2018-03-04 11:45:02	Xano	It's about the same docstring, in the same class, and fixing the D203 causes the D211 and vice versa.

2018-03-04 12:44:16	bonestormii_	I don't know when it was most recently updated
2018-03-04 12:45:03	_habnabit	Richard_Cavell, it's complicated. i don't know why it chooses to consider a comment at a >>> prompt enough to show the ... prompt
2018-03-04 12:46:48	_habnabit	Richard_Cavell, but honestly, if you're writing anything that requires an indented block, you probably shouldn't be writing it on the REPL
2018-03-04 12:49:57	Richard_Cavell	REPL means read-eval-print-loop?
2018-03-04 12:50:08	Richard_Cavell	As in, the interactive prompt/shell/immediate mode thingy
2018-03-04 12:50:16	Habbie	yes
2018-03-04 12:50:21	_habnabit	Richard_Cavell, the >>> prompt is the REPL
2018-03-04 12:53:37	bonestormii_	Richard_Cavell, there are a few "advanced" versions of the REPL that have features that make using the REPL for multi-line indented blocks a bit more reasonable, but it would be indeed be much more efficient to simply write your code to a .py file
2018-03-04 12:53:57	bonestormii_	then you can call that code from the REPL if you choose.
2018-03-04 12:54:33	bonestormii_	https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython
2018-03-04 12:55:40	Richard_Cavell	bonestormii_, Yes, I saw tht
2018-03-04 12:59:03	vlt	csanjeev25: There seems to be an updated version of “Two Scoops” for each of the LTS releases.
2018-03-04 13:00:32	bonestormii_	the Django docs are also famous for being decent, too
2018-03-04 13:01:33	csanjeev25	yeah, django docs are good...

2018-03-04 13:37:49	jfhbrook	depends foo, why are there null chars in your shit?
2018-03-04 13:38:07	jfhbrook	is it actually binary data? or malformed unicode? do you know?
2018-03-04 13:40:37	foo	jfhbrook: A web crawl picked this up and had this error in the url cache table. The url cache stores a url, and it stores the "expanded_url" eg. a bit.ly link rdirects somewhere, it'll store both the bit.ly link and where it redirects. Beyond that, I recently add "error" to capture exceptions. eg. error = '{} {}'.format(sys.exc_info()[0], sys.exc_info()[1]) - I don't know how this happened, really.
2018-03-04 13:41:29	jfhbrook	hmmmm
2018-03-04 13:41:47	jfhbrook	based on what I know you have a few options
2018-03-04 13:41:56	jfhbrook	1) use some kinda blob binary storage mechanism for your data
2018-03-04 13:42:09	jfhbrook	(I think there's a blog datatype in postgres)
2018-03-04 13:42:11	jfhbrook	blob*
2018-03-04 13:42:24	jfhbrook	2) reject the redirect completely, since it sounds to *me* like its malformed
2018-03-04 13:42:48	foo	jfhbrook: just added my model here: https://paste.ofcode.org/7HX4FuRDHAePmviY5m8bzQ - yeah, I don't really know what else it would come from, and the error doesn't tell me what column this is happening in
2018-03-04 13:42:55	jfhbrook	2) probably involves test searches, and warning null byte injection as a fuzzing technique is a thing people do
2018-03-04 13:43:51	jfhbrook	3) convert to some expected encoding (is this even technicially a thing with urls? it might not be) and use decoding options to throw out "bad" characters
2018-03-04 13:43:58	foo	jfhbrook: I like 2), I'll add a try/except to catch this, figure out what data is causing this - and then make sure it gets stripped out. Now, let's say I add try/except to catch this - if I print(the_dict) to stdout, would I see a null char?
2018-03-04 13:44:01	jfhbrook	urls might be ascii with punycode
2018-03-04 13:44:12	Habbie	the host names, yes
2018-03-04 13:44:14	Habbie	not the path
2018-03-04 13:44:53	jfhbrook	null chars are iirc zero length but a repr (so what you'd see if you printed the_dict I suspect) will probably show \x00 instead
2018-03-04 13:44:57	foo	jfhbrook: lines 3-6 : https://paste.ofcode.org/F8CZsdLAXEg35DkMdWFEby - I added a function I use in other parts of my code to "clean the text" - would this catch a null char I wonder and strip it?
2018-03-04 13:45:09	Habbie	jfhbrook, length one, not zero
2018-03-04 13:45:22	foo	I think we can agree a null char is not coming from error = '{} {}'.format(sys.exc_info()[0], sys.exc_info()[1])
2018-03-04 13:45:35	Habbie	it could, theoretically
2018-03-04 13:45:38	Habbie	it's just not likely
2018-03-04 13:45:42	foo	Habbie: gotcha
2018-03-04 13:45:43	foo	Habbie: thank you
2018-03-04 13:45:48	jfhbrook	 Habbie: as in when you do len(str) or as in how wide the char is when you print it?
2018-03-04 13:45:55	Habbie	jfhbrook, both
2018-03-04 13:46:00	jfhbrook	hm
2018-03-04 13:46:05	foo	how would I even produce a null char?
2018-03-04 13:46:08	foo	myself?
2018-03-04 13:46:09	Habbie	jfhbrook, certainly len; printing it might look like a normal space, or indeed have zero width, depending on terminal etc.
2018-03-04 13:46:11	Habbie	foo, chr(0)
2018-03-04 13:46:34	foo	Habbie: thank you
2018-03-04 13:47:17	jfhbrook	just keep in mind that regexps on really long strings can add up to being an attack vector, one of my libs got CVE'd over a regexp validating against null bytes in urls
2018-03-04 13:47:30	foo	Actually, I wouldn't want to throw this out, I would want to capture the error. The reason: requests probably pulls content properly on the page, and we'll want that, we'll just have to note the expanded_url may have an error (there is an error column for that)
2018-03-04 13:47:35	jfhbrook	so maybe throw out by length first
2018-03-04 13:47:46	catern	are there any useful helpers or decorators or something which make it easier to have a locked object?
2018-03-04 13:48:06	catern	as in, an object that takes an object-global lock whenever you call its methods
2018-03-04 13:48:12	foo	So, in that case, how do I strip null chars?
2018-03-04 13:48:33	foo	a.strip('\x00')

2018-03-04 13:55:20	nedbat	catern: it wouldn't be hard to write a decorator like that.
2018-03-04 13:56:12	Habbie	nedbat, you'd need some magic to make it apply to all methods, right?
2018-03-04 13:56:19	catern	nedbat: indeed it would not be, but I'm wondering if there's something in the standard library
2018-03-04 13:56:58	nedbat	Habbie: or you decorate each method
2018-03-04 13:57:02	Habbie	nedbat, sure

2018-03-04 14:08:33	deniska	(I do too though)
2018-03-04 14:08:37	_habnabit	deniska, i think you meant to say 'biggest'
2018-03-04 14:08:44	runciter	i thought the latest release was 5.10.0
2018-03-04 14:08:58	nanonyme	runciter, you mean of PyPy?
2018-03-04 14:09:13	runciter	nanonyme: of my default interpreter :)
2018-03-04 14:09:30	nanonyme	Latest stable branch of CPython should be unambiguous though
2018-03-04 14:11:02	nanonyme	2.7 is not the latest stable branch so you can't really misunderstand that even if you want to
2018-03-04 14:12:54	nanonyme	runciter, although unless you meant to say "my default interpreter of choise" instead of "my default interpreter", you have a really interesting distro
2018-03-04 14:13:03	nanonyme	Choice even

2018-03-04 14:14:54	deniska	In the world of docker and snaps/flatpak, targeting a specific python version because "our enterprise linux install comes with it" feels quite sad
2018-03-04 14:15:09	rodrigc	does Raymond Hettinger hang out on this channel?
2018-03-04 14:15:48	nanonyme	deniska, you don't obviously need to target your default interpreter anyhow
2018-03-04 14:16:21	deniska	nanonyme: it's obvious to me, but not too obvious for these centos guys with 2.5 or something :)
2018-03-04 14:17:18	scruz	is there a different way to call the superclass method than how i did it here https://bpaste.net/show/631328855f70? i tried using super() with no arguments, but i got a RuntimeError
2018-03-04 14:17:41	Habbie	scruz, what's the full error?
2018-03-04 14:18:09	scruz	RuntimeError: super(): __class__ cell not found
2018-03-04 14:18:10	nanonyme	deniska, aren't those CentOS versions realistically EOL?
2018-03-04 14:18:19	itsfreezing	Hi, is portaudio a bit broken on windows xp (not tried later versions) - It seems to completely ignore the windows mixer (kmixer?) setting for "wave" volume / mute. It uses the "master volume" volume / mute okay but ignores wave :S I have tried with both pyaudio and sounddevice libs and it's the same with both.
2018-03-04 14:18:44	deniska	nanonyme: given a possibility, people don't update software ever
2018-03-04 14:18:50	Habbie	centos 5/6/7 have 2.4.3, 2.6.6, 2.7.5 respectively
2018-03-04 14:19:02	scruz	Habbie the paste works, but if i replace L9 with "result = super().validate()", i get the RuntimeError
2018-03-04 14:19:09	nanonyme	scruz, Python2?
2018-03-04 14:19:17	Habbie	scruz, because your custom_validator does not have a super()
2018-03-04 14:19:19	nedbat	rodrigc: no
2018-03-04 14:19:20	Habbie	scruz, because it's not a method
2018-03-04 14:19:25	deniska	scruz: super requires a reference to a class which is kinda hard to get when the class is created after a function
2018-03-04 14:19:36	nanonyme	Ooh, right, that

2018-03-04 14:24:30	runciter	expectocode: what line exactly?
2018-03-04 14:24:38	runciter	is it iteration that's slow?
2018-03-04 14:25:20	expectocode	i don't know how to get that info from cProfile
2018-03-04 14:26:14	runciter	expectocode: it just lists this function as the top in totcalls or something?
2018-03-04 14:26:46	nedbat	expectocode: seems like you want a binary search rather than a linear search
2018-03-04 14:26:46	nanonyme	runciter, is that really fair after this short waiting period?
2018-03-04 14:27:18	expectocode	runciter, yeah the line number it gives is the function definition

2018-03-04 14:27:29	expectocode	nedbat, the data isnt sorted, but i could ask for the DB to sort it first
2018-03-04 14:27:47	runciter	then you can try the bisect i linked to
2018-03-04 14:27:48	expectocode	before this, i was making a query to the DB for every bin, but it turned out one query and manual binning was faster
2018-03-04 14:27:51	_habnabit	expectocode, if it's not sorted, why do you return the first one?
2018-03-04 14:27:51	nedbat	expectocode: if it isn't sorted, then how does it make sense to search it linearly? What is it meant to do?
2018-03-04 14:28:10	expectocode	_habnabit, sorry i misunderstood. yes, time_data is sorted
2018-03-04 14:28:36	nedbat	expectocode: then i agree with runciter: bisect is worth trying.
2018-03-04 14:28:38	expectocode	it's part of a function to get data from a DB with an associated date and put it into bins
2018-03-04 14:28:45	expectocode	i'll give bisect a try
2018-03-04 14:31:41	acresearch	watching people program python on twitch, very interesting, maybe i should do the same :-)
2018-03-04 14:32:18	achillion	I dunno

2018-03-04 14:36:27	nanonyme	runciter, the delay between waiting for a response from PR author to PR getting taken over because of lack of response
2018-03-04 14:37:22	runciter	nanonyme: i've had my eye on the PR for a while - craig's email when out like over a month after the PR was submitted
2018-03-04 14:37:28	runciter	went* out
2018-03-04 14:38:11	runciter	nanonyme: in the general case you're right, but i have some extra context as twisted contributor
2018-03-04 14:38:20	runciter	that wasn't clear though
2018-03-04 14:40:03	dtux	are type hints for lambdas a thing?
2018-03-04 14:40:56	_habnabit	dtux, not directly
2018-03-04 14:41:41	dtux	ty
2018-03-04 14:43:03	expectocode	wow! bisect cut my time from 9.6 sec to 2.1 sec
2018-03-04 14:43:16	expectocode	thanks nedbat runciter
2018-03-04 14:45:30	nanonyme	runciter, right, I was more referring to the fact the email only went out six days ago
2018-03-04 14:46:25	intx	how do I test if a string contains more than 50% capital letters?
2018-03-04 14:46:34	_habnabit	intx, what part is giving you trouble?
2018-03-04 14:46:54	intx	counting the number of capital letters
2018-03-04 14:47:22	_habnabit	intx, use a for loop
2018-03-04 14:47:35	expectocode	a list comprehension would work there, unless you want to get all technical about unicode capitalisation
2018-03-04 14:47:52	_habnabit	expectocode, why would a list comprehension fail with unicode?
2018-03-04 14:48:55	expectocode	communication is hard, lol. it wouldnt fail you'd just need a more complex function to check if its capitalised
2018-03-04 14:49:13	_habnabit	expectocode, not unicode.isupper() ?
2018-03-04 14:49:20	expectocode	TIL
2018-03-04 14:49:53	_habnabit	expectocode, of course, then you get into 'well, are we talking about percentage of code points, or percentage of grapheme clusters'
2018-03-04 14:51:04	expectocode	haha, yeah
2018-03-04 14:51:22	KirkMcDonald	_habnabit: Percentage of em-widths, obviously.

2018-03-04 14:53:24	SpeakerToMeat	Hello
2018-03-04 14:55:05	intx	would it be better to use a for loop like this: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/38sTw8mpmGLnCutSuUBN/
2018-03-04 14:55:49	intx	or a regex like this: re.search(r"([^A-Za-z]++|[A-Z](?1)*?[a-z]|[a-z](?1)*?[A-Z])*+[A-Z]?",s)?
2018-03-04 14:56:00	intx	(which would be lighter on the cpu?)
2018-03-04 14:58:58	SpeakerToMeat	Two quick questions about ElementTree working on modifying a file loaded xml... A) the xml uses several namespaces including an unnamed one but ET 1) adds a name to the unnamed ns 2) changes the names of the other ones. Any way I can avoid this? B) on output doesn't add a <?xml version="1.0".. any way to have it added by ET?
2018-03-04 14:59:14	confluency	intx: do you actualy have a performance problem?
2018-03-04 14:59:55	nanonyme	intx, probably the loop but that algorithm doesn't solve the problem you were originally asking about
2018-03-04 15:00:22	confluency	intx: what are you actually trying to do? Check if most of the string is uppercase letters?
2018-03-04 15:00:24	nanonyme	The thing you were originally asking about would by far be most sensible solved through a loop
2018-03-04 15:00:26	_habnabit	SpeakerToMeat, 'unnamed namespace' is only about how the tags are serialized; the tags still all _have_ a namespace
2018-03-04 15:00:30	intx	confluency: yes
2018-03-04 15:00:34	confluency	intx: most of the entire string, or just most of the letters?
2018-03-04 15:00:45	intx	most of the entire string
2018-03-04 15:00:48	SpeakerToMeat	_habnabit: Yeah
2018-03-04 15:01:27	_habnabit	SpeakerToMeat, so.. why do the names in the serialized output matter?
2018-03-04 15:01:44	SpeakerToMeat	hmm
2018-03-04 15:02:18	SpeakerToMeat	well I want to conserver them, and I want to avoid names being added to a lot of elements that didn't have one explicitly specified before
2018-03-04 15:02:27	_habnabit	SpeakerToMeat, ok, but why does that matter?
2018-03-04 15:02:46	confluency	intx: um(c.isupper() for c in yourstring)/len(yourstring)
2018-03-04 15:02:58	confluency	intx: sorry, sum(c.isupper() for c in yourstring)/len(yourstring)
2018-03-04 15:03:15	_habnabit	SpeakerToMeat, you can specify an nsmap, i think, but it shouldn't make a difference as semantically the content is the same
2018-03-04 15:03:32	confluency	intx: or rather sum(c.isupper() for c in foo)/len(foo) >= 0.5
2018-03-04 15:04:34	SpeakerToMeat	_habnabit: And do I have to set the nsmap by hand or is there any way it can be parsed from xml?
2018-03-04 15:05:02	intx	confluency: thanks :)
2018-03-04 15:05:44	nedbat	intx: if you don't mind me asking, why do you want to know if the string is mostly uppercase?
2018-03-04 15:07:51	runciter	SpeakerToMeat: an nsmap is just shorthand for namespaces, and you have you choose the shorthand
2018-03-04 15:08:23	intx	nedbat: I'm running a filter on a forum to notify me of topics of interest, and usually the topics which are written in mostly uppercase are not interesting to me
2018-03-04 15:08:33	nedbat	intx: good call

2018-03-04 15:11:51	jackarius86	hi, i am trying to use subprocess.call to fuzz for a buffer overflow and am discovering it has its limitations. is there an easy way around this, or should i be using another function/language??
2018-03-04 15:11:59	runciter	SpeakerToMeat: always use lxml
2018-03-04 15:13:58	SpeakerToMeat	runciter: It seems that's a good recommendation
2018-03-04 15:14:57	nanonyme	I really wish lxml defaulted in static compilation being on in Windows so the source tarballs worked out of the box on Windows
2018-03-04 15:16:34	nanonyme	I mean, sure, the wheel *do* work but lxml won't result in anything useful when you run the source tarball unless you set a special environment variable on
2018-03-04 15:18:28	nedbat	jackarius86: what limitations?

2018-03-04 15:26:25	sidni	lol
2018-03-04 15:27:49	nanonyme	nedbat, you also need to go through weird hacks to even get past 260 characters on most Windows machines still
2018-03-04 15:27:50	sidni	im sort of confused what to do after basics and doing many tutorials. i just dont know what to do to become independent
2018-03-04 15:28:19	nedbat	sidni: write something of your own

2018-03-04 15:29:41	sidni	ahah nice
2018-03-04 15:30:06	sidni	and can anyone vouch for checkio.org
2018-03-04 15:30:16	sidni	not sure if it will help
2018-03-04 15:30:52	nanonyme	ChrisWarrick, "fix"
2018-03-04 15:31:33	nanonyme	ChrisWarrick, if you enable it, you allow arbitrary amount of breakage on the operating systems through software that assumes there is such a thing as MAX_PATH
2018-03-04 15:32:56	nanonyme	If it was safe to enable it, *Microsoft* would do that
2018-03-04 15:33:20	sidni	your right
2018-03-04 15:39:06	SpeakerToMeat	Ok I'm not gonna try to understand argparse right now, I0'm just using it quickly, can someone please explain to me... I have a couple files arguments, one is always needed... but another is needed if an extra arg is added. Any way I can do that?
2018-03-04 15:40:12	SpeakerToMeat	I'm doing this so far.... https://hastebin.com/boyajelawo.bash the idea here is, if -f (--fix) is specified, then outfile NEEDS to be there, so nargs should change from ?......

2018-03-04 15:47:21	SpeakerToMeat	hmmm
2018-03-04 15:51:33	bbert	When using list comprehensions, you can limit the results based on a test, like this: [x for x in range(100) if x % 2 == 3] .... I want to do something like the following, but without calculating "x+1" twice:  [(x, x+1) for x in range(100) if (x + 1) % 2 == 3] ... is there an idiomatic way of doing that?
2018-03-04 15:51:49	SpeakerToMeat	altendky: like so? https://hastebin.com/ijuqujewis.bash
2018-03-04 15:51:49	infobob	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/GDouxmij4n6AqzDxf1a6/ (repasted for SpeakerToMeat)
2018-03-04 15:54:14	altendky	SpeakerToMeat: I don't think you need nargs? And should be able to pick a file type. I think argparse has that.  Also, click is often recommended over argparse
2018-03-04 15:54:52	SpeakerToMeat	click?
2018-03-04 15:54:55	altendky	bbert: you could nest, but...
2018-03-04 15:55:02	altendky	SpeakerToMeat: yup
2018-03-04 15:55:41	nanonyme	bbert, I don't think so but pretty sure the cost of x + 1 is negligible compared to modulo arithmetics
2018-03-04 15:56:09	nanonyme	bbert, you could always write a generator function
2018-03-04 15:56:28	SpeakerToMeat	Interesting to see an external lib recommended over a builtin
2018-03-04 15:56:42	nanonyme	SpeakerToMeat, isn't that really common?
2018-03-04 15:56:50	altendky	SpeakerToMeat: it's pretty common for anything but the basics
2018-03-04 15:56:52	deniska	SpeakerToMeat: not all builtins are created equal
2018-03-04 15:56:54	bbert	nanonyme: my example is simplified... I'm not actually using  x+1 ... in my actual application the x+1 is O(n^3), and I don't want to memoize it
2018-03-04 15:57:48	nanonyme	bbert, right. Consider writing a loop then
2018-03-04 15:58:03	altendky	bbert: if it's a function call you could @lru_cache
2018-03-04 15:58:19	bbert	altendky:  so... like this:  [(x, y) for x, y in [(x, x+1) for x in range(100)] if y % 2 == 3]
2018-03-04 15:58:46	nanonyme	If you write it as a loop instead of trying to keep it a list comprehension, it's really simple to calculate the thing only once
2018-03-04 15:59:09	Filarius	is here messaging protocol what I can add on top of my own data transport implementating? Just to sent requests and data arrays between applications
2018-03-04 15:59:26	altendky	bbert: yes, but a genexp inside and I didn't mean I liked it
2018-03-04 15:59:53	altendky	bbert: if your calculation is expensive just loop I guess. Or generator function
2018-03-04 16:00:01	bbert	altendky and nanonyme: thanks.  just tried nested comprehension, and it's clean and fast (in my situation).  Thanks... I'm still not used to thinking in python
2018-03-04 16:00:31	nanonyme	bbert, writing loop is typically far easier to read than nested comprehensions for the next person
2018-03-04 16:01:09	altendky	^^^
2018-03-04 16:02:26	altendky	I think comprehensions have some performance benefit but I'd expect it to be small compared to anything costly (like was described)
2018-03-04 16:02:37	SpeakerToMeat	Ok, how do I preserve special characters in elements text when serializing an lxml etree?
2018-03-04 16:03:07	altendky	SpeakerToMeat: full code and show the issue?
2018-03-04 16:04:08	SpeakerToMeat	I mean I have an element in utf8 for example: <p>'</p> and serializer outputs: <p>&#8217;</p>
2018-03-04 16:05:16	altendky	SpeakerToMeat: isn't that proper encoding into xml?
2018-03-04 16:05:18	nanonyme	I doubt that's actually ' then
2018-03-04 16:05:26	altendky	Other than that...
2018-03-04 16:05:40	SpeakerToMeat	It is '
2018-03-04 16:06:02	SpeakerToMeat	Ok. the encoding of the source xml is disregarded, I need to determine it, or manually set encoding to utf-8
2018-03-04 16:06:42	altendky	SpeakerToMeat: http://www.codetable.net/decimal/8217
2018-03-04 16:06:45	SpeakerToMeat	And the encoding is there.
2018-03-04 16:06:46	nanonyme	I don't believe it. It probably just looks like ' to you
2018-03-04 16:07:14	nanonyme	Right, it's ´ or whatever instead
2018-03-04 16:07:52	SpeakerToMeat	Nod
2018-03-04 16:07:56	SpeakerToMeat	I'm not surprised
2018-03-04 16:08:06	altendky	SpeakerToMeat: so, isn't that correct encoding?
2018-03-04 16:08:36	nanonyme	Although right, you don't want entity-escaping there but the bare UTF-8 sequence
2018-03-04 16:09:36	SpeakerToMeat	altendky: If the output is ascii yes, I wasn't carrying the original encoding to the serializer
2018-03-04 16:09:56	SpeakerToMeat	I grabbed the docinfo from the origin and used same encoding for the serializer, all is well now

2018-03-04 16:28:27	ic2000	is it legal/okay to use a keyword/built in function name as a class method?
2018-03-04 16:28:31	ic2000	e.g. self.quit
2018-03-04 16:28:58	bjs	ic2000: quit isn't a builtin?
2018-03-04 16:29:17	bjs	ic2000: it's legal to shadow builtins yes, but not legal to try shadow keywords (that's kind of the definition of a "keyword" I guess)
2018-03-04 16:29:25	ic2000	bjs, well i accidentally called quit() and the program exited
2018-03-04 16:29:40	bjs	oh it is one
2018-03-04 16:29:42	Habbie	it's in `site`
2018-03-04 16:29:51	Habbie	ic2000, so your question is two questions
2018-03-04 16:29:56	Habbie	ic2000, one about keywords, one about builtins
2018-03-04 16:29:59	cryzed	I'm using a QActionGroup and add several existing actions to it. However, calling setEnabled/setDisabled on it, does not seem to activate/enable the contained actions. Any ideas why that could be? Code is here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3c5a482c8c0e37dd2abdafe28d9300e9, problem occurs after calling MainWindow.open
2018-03-04 16:30:23	Habbie	ic2000, you generally cannot use keywords and you will get an error immediately
2018-03-04 16:30:34	ic2000	Habbie, if keywords and built ins are treated differently, then i only care about the latter
2018-03-04 16:30:38	Habbie	ic2000, you can use the names of 'builtins' legally but expect confusing problems in your future
2018-03-04 16:30:48	Habbie	like:
2018-03-04 16:30:50	Habbie	>>> list = list()
2018-03-04 16:30:52	Habbie	>>> list = list()
2018-03-04 16:30:54	Habbie	Traceback (most recent call last):
2018-03-04 16:31:01	Habbie	the first one works
2018-03-04 16:31:04	Habbie	the second one fails
2018-03-04 16:31:08	Habbie	because i redefined what list is
2018-03-04 16:31:09	bjs	ic2000: keywords are things like "if" and "def", builtins are just functions in "the" global namespace like open/input
2018-03-04 16:31:32	bjs	ic2000: since the latter are just functions with names, you can shadow them like any other functions with names
2018-03-04 16:31:43	ic2000	okay, great then. ty
2018-03-04 16:31:45	Habbie	not just functions, also True/False etc.
2018-03-04 16:31:50	Habbie	which are SUPER FUN to redefine ;)
2018-03-04 16:31:59	bjs	Habbie: (thankfully you cannot redefine True/False anymore)
2018-03-04 16:32:03	ic2000	doesn't sound like a good idea
2018-03-04 16:32:17	Habbie	hmm i lost my python3
2018-03-04 16:32:18	Habbie	oh brew upgrade

2018-03-04 16:33:56	expectocode	ic2000, i would guess yes
2018-03-04 16:34:52	nedbat	ic2000: if you pastebin the code, and give us some idea of what you are looking for, you will get opinions
2018-03-04 16:34:53	ic2000	great, well here's my little game class https://bpaste.net/show/7bad8b2cbde5 would appreciate any criticism on it
2018-03-04 16:35:01	ic2000	especially how i've used the classes
2018-03-04 16:38:38	bonestormii_	at first glance, your code looks reasonably nice to me, ic2000.
2018-03-04 16:39:16	ic2000	bonestormii_, thanks, anything u would change or should i continue?
2018-03-04 16:39:55	bonestormii_	I might suggest moving self.run() out of __init__() and instead call it on the instantiated object under if __name__ == "main":
2018-03-04 16:40:22	bonestormii_	It makes little difference, but that's really where you are executing your program, and you may find reason to create instances of the object without running them right away.
2018-03-04 16:40:35	ic2000	ah okay, will change that now. thanks
2018-03-04 16:42:32	bonestormii_	There are some other things that I might recommend, but you can decide for yourself
2018-03-04 16:42:54	bonestormii_	Take set_window(self)
2018-03-04 16:43:18	bonestormii_	, to me, it's better if that function is made to take the arguments w_width and w_height directly
2018-03-04 16:43:48	bonestormii_	and then when you call it in the __init__ function, you pass those arguments straight through from __init__'s arguments
2018-03-04 16:44:19	bonestormii_	Does that make sense?
2018-03-04 16:47:09	ic2000	bonestormii_, hmm yeah, my only issue is that the width and height never change in the menu. it's changed in the game class, set_window is then called again after to remake the menu
2018-03-04 16:49:57	bonestormii_	I'm not really that familiar with pygame so consider the possibility that you know best
2018-03-04 16:50:16	bonestormii_	but to me, it's much more correct to say like
2018-03-04 16:50:44	bonestormii_	Sokoban.set_window(w_width, w_heighth, caption)
2018-03-04 16:50:51	bonestormii_	than like
2018-03-04 16:51:09	bonestormii_	Sokoban.w_width =  5
2018-03-04 16:51:18	bonestormii_	Sokoman.w_height = 5
2018-03-04 16:51:33	bonestormii_	Sokoban.caption = "some caption"

2018-03-04 16:51:56	bonestormii_	which as far as I can tell, is the only real difference.
2018-03-04 16:52:05	bonestormii_	I'm not sure why you might need it the other way
2018-03-04 16:53:40	ic2000	bonestormii_, i see where ur coming from, i'll change it. ty
2018-03-04 16:54:58	xqb	Hope we learned something these days. hf
2018-03-04 16:55:16	bonestormii_	You could also consider making those three attributes properties instead
2018-03-04 16:55:31	bonestormii_	and then call set_window() every time the properties are updated
2018-03-04 16:58:52	bonestormii_	it would also allow you to set constraints on the width and height allowed
2018-03-04 17:07:55	disruptivefour	Hey guys, I'm having a hard time with a problem I'm working on in python. I describe it in detail in the link below. I'd really appreciate if on of you guys could help me out. Thanks. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49088385/creating-2d-list-using-for-loop-in-python3-for-vigenere-cipher

2018-03-04 17:45:20	tacomaster	If I am getting a warning for method may be static, is that really an issue?
2018-03-04 17:48:21	MrElendig	usually not, might be a hint that it could be written as a standalone func instead though
2018-03-04 17:48:22	disruptivefour	runciter, what do you mean by that? Is that an algorithm that will fix my problem?
2018-03-04 17:48:41	runciter	disruptivefour: try it and see
2018-03-04 17:51:28	Soni	so uh I noticed python has no way of specifying command-line modules?
2018-03-04 17:51:53	disruptivefour	runciter, it doesn't seem to be working. Here's by current code, if maybe that's causing the problem. If you could make a PR I'd really appreciate it. https://github.com/PwnKitteh/vigenere
2018-03-04 17:52:05	Soni	in lua there's `lua -l module`, but I see no equivalent in python
2018-03-04 17:53:41	MrElendig	Soni: -m?
2018-03-04 17:53:58	Soni	MrElendig: I'm not trying to run a module as a script
2018-03-04 17:54:06	Soni	I'm trying to insert "import module" into the script
2018-03-04 17:54:19	teratorn	uh
2018-03-04 17:54:27	teratorn	Soni: why?
2018-03-04 17:54:52	Soni	feature-flags for a script, basically
2018-03-04 17:55:07	Soni	yeah sure I could use normal arguments but w/e
2018-03-04 17:55:21	ChrisWarrick	you should be using normal arguments
2018-03-04 17:55:25	teratorn	an implicit "import module" doesn't make sense in Python
2018-03-04 17:55:31	ChrisWarrick	or config files (which should not be .py files either)
2018-03-04 17:55:46	teratorn	except when they should
2018-03-04 17:55:46	Soni	teratorn: try: module.thing except: whatever?
2018-03-04 17:56:34	Soni	also would be cool "import othermodule as module"
2018-03-04 17:56:34	teratorn	Soni: can you elaborate on what you're trying to do specifically?
2018-03-04 17:56:48	teratorn	Soni: you can do that...
2018-03-04 17:57:04	Soni	with scripts written like "try: module except: import module"
2018-03-04 17:57:17	Soni	then you specify monkeypatch modules on the CLI
2018-03-04 17:57:35	teratorn	it doesn't make sense... just import the modules you need, if you have optional ones, then put a try/catch around the import
2018-03-04 17:57:42	SaltyCatFish	in terms of unit testing and pytest... to do your imports do  you have to install your package?
2018-03-04 17:58:04	tacomaster	Ok, I am working on a game and I know this works but I am trying to find a way to declare the traits once and call it in different parts with out having to retype tons of code. So far I have https://paste.pound-python.org/show/STnZPqPOy0qUrx2iyOlj/
2018-03-04 17:58:33	SaltyCatFish	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/ce6zMoDAcWF8RHtgBW8F/
2018-03-04 17:58:43	SaltyCatFish	I can't get the imports to work without installing the module
2018-03-04 17:58:56	tacomaster	the part I am trying to expand is the first trait at the very bottom. At the moment I have a 30% chance to happen normally but I want to call it again if the parents have the trait to raise the percentage of happening
2018-03-04 17:59:54	jwarren	Hey folks, I might be overthinking this, but I'm trying to put a bunch of bytecode together as hex instructions. I started using the struct module to do this, but I'm not getting far. For example, I want to be able to take 0x123456 and 0xabcdef and little endian hex encode them to \xef\xcd\xab\x56...etc. I couldn't figure out how to do this with struct, am I doing it wrong?
2018-03-04 18:00:02	MrElendig	tacomaster: json/similar is handy for setting up traits/whatever
2018-03-04 18:00:37	MrElendig	instead of hardcoding them in the code
2018-03-04 18:00:38	Soni	--use-module debug, for scripts with optional debugging?
2018-03-04 18:01:24	tacomaster	MrElendig: I'm sorry I am not following what you are trying to say. Isn't json a web language?
2018-03-04 18:01:39	MrElendig	tacomaster: it is not a language
2018-03-04 18:01:59	MrElendig	https://www.json.org/
2018-03-04 18:02:18	MrElendig	could use any number of other formats instead too ofcourse
2018-03-04 18:03:06	tacomaster	MrElendig: Im lost at why putting it in the code is a bad idea. Expecally since they don't chance how much they add
2018-03-04 18:03:36	MrElendig	point is to have them defined not in code directly, so that you don't have to modify all your code just because you want to add a new trait or remove one
2018-03-04 18:04:22	tacomaster	MrElendig: that makes more since. Do you happen to have a website that explains more of what you are trying to explain so I don't keep bugging you till I get it lol
2018-03-04 18:04:39	sigdk	is it OK to store the object hashCode in DB ?
2018-03-04 18:05:43	MrElendig	the same for items/creatures/etc
2018-03-04 18:07:12	sigdk	I need to know if an object at hand has a record in my DB and I was thinking to keep something in memory (all objects hashCodes) before quering the DB

2018-03-04 18:09:00	dmartins	disruptivefour: you are on the right track with the code on stackoverflow
2018-03-04 18:10:09	dmartins	a couple of tweaks and it should work.. first, assuming cipher should be the 2d array, start by initializing it as an empty list: cipher = []
2018-03-04 18:10:45	dmartins	then each time through your loop, just append the results of shift
2018-03-04 18:11:22	tacomaster	MrElendig: are you familiar  with building games?
2018-03-04 18:11:36	dmartins	cipher.append(shift(.....
2018-03-04 18:12:44	dmartins	then update lastList to be the last element in cipher (like you had commented out but global is not needed)
2018-03-04 18:15:01	anon^_^	hi a small question in regard to this ticket
2018-03-04 18:15:03	anon^_^	https://bugs.python.org/issue11380
2018-03-04 18:16:41	anon^_^	is there some way to silence errors without modifying files when piping output of python into another linux command. python.py | less
2018-03-04 18:16:56	anon^_^	or similar commands
2018-03-04 18:17:20	anon^_^	sorry python source.py | less
2018-03-04 18:17:23	anon^_^	etc
2018-03-04 18:18:15	jwarren	anon^_^: Could you redirect stderr? I doubt this would work exactly, but something like python.py 2>/dev/null | less?
2018-03-04 18:18:28	anon^_^	that doesn't work
2018-03-04 18:19:54	anon^_^	python still passes this error >> close failed in file object destructor: sys.excepthook is missing lost sys.stderr
2018-03-04 18:20:45	anon^_^	that error gets thrown when envoking python a second time in the same script
2018-03-04 18:22:08	altendky	anon^_^: share full code and full output and point out the output you don't like
2018-03-04 18:22:43	anon^_^	isn't mine to share, hence I'm asking about the bug
2018-03-04 18:23:26	anon^_^	seems to be an issue with python not failing gracefully when output is piped into another program
2018-03-04 18:23:31	dmartins	disruptivefour: but one more thing to keep in mind is how assignment works in python. you need to create a copy of a list explicitly, otherwise both variables point to the same list. lastList = cipher[-1].copy()
2018-03-04 18:24:03	altendky	anon^_^: what is the minimal example code you can run that shows your issue?
2018-03-04 18:26:17	anon^_^	can't share the py file. That can't be modified.  The exception error is returned when envoking python more than once in the same script
2018-03-04 18:26:20	anon^_^	i.e.
2018-03-04 18:26:39	anon^_^	python source.py | less;  python source.py | less
2018-03-04 18:27:17	anon^_^	happens with grep as well
2018-03-04 18:27:36	anon^_^	problem is documented here
2018-03-04 18:27:37	anon^_^	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12790328/how-to-silence-sys-excepthook-is-missing-error/24960911
2018-03-04 18:27:52	altendky	anon^_^: I was asking for an example that exhibits the issue... If you put those two calls on separate lines instead of ; does it matter?
2018-03-04 18:28:03	anon^_^	and there is no solution other than not using python, or modifying the python file
2018-03-04 18:28:36	altendky	anon^_^: I'm confused about separate python processes running at different times affecting each other
2018-03-04 18:29:39	anon^_^	altendky, i ran a trap, to test.  the error did not seem to appear until a second python attempt was envoked
2018-03-04 18:29:55	⚡	Lunatrius` is now known as Lunatrius
2018-03-04 18:30:10	anon^_^	it is related to that stackoverflow link and the bug report
2018-03-04 18:30:29	altendky	anon^_^: certainly you have run it successfully multiple times. If you put a sleep between is it ok?
2018-03-04 18:30:38	anon^_^	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12790328/how-to-silence-sys-excepthook-is-missing-error/24960911#comment42997916_12807285
2018-03-04 18:33:15	anon^_^	altendky, another example when python source.py | grep -q
2018-03-04 18:33:17	anon^_^	https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/305547/broken-pipe-when-grepping-output-but-only-with-i-flag
2018-03-04 18:41:21	anon^_^	altendy, yes i tested with a sleep 5
2018-03-04 18:41:34	anon^_^	altendky
2018-03-04 18:42:55	altendky	anon^_^: how short is reliably ok? Also, make an example you can share... Both python and bash (?) scripts
2018-03-04 18:44:38	anon^_^	for i in "${files[@]}: do python source.py | head -1; done
2018-03-04 18:44:52	anon^_^	for i in "${files[@]}: do python source.py | grep -q; done
2018-03-04 18:45:01	altendky	anon^_^: gist or such
2018-03-04 18:45:36	anon^_^	sorry forgot to end that double quote around the array variable
2018-03-04 18:46:04	anon^_^	it's the same error condition exibited in those stackexchange links
2018-03-04 18:48:18	altendky	anon^_^: if you want help you generally need to provide your own example and output instead of expecting us to piece it together from a bunch of other sources.
2018-03-04 18:48:30	ali1234	how can i import a module when i have the full source of the module in a string variable?
2018-03-04 18:48:36	altendky	We want to see what you are running and getting, not somebody else
2018-03-04 18:49:09	altendky	ali1234: how did that happen :]
2018-03-04 18:49:15	anon^_^	altendky, i can't share the source.py. i can't modify it either. Hence linking the bug report, and stackexchange links
2018-03-04 18:50:15	altendky	anon^_^: not sure how many times to tell you to make an example you can share
2018-03-04 18:50:20	anon^_^	if you try piping python output via linux commandline and then envoking one of these conditions (source.py | less, source.py | head -1, source.py | grep -q) they all fail
2018-03-04 18:50:40	altendky	anon^_^: you said it only failed the second time it was called...
2018-03-04 18:50:55	altendky	Without delay
2018-03-04 18:51:57	ali1234	altendky: the source code will be received from somewhere other than the filesystem. i guess i could just save it and then import it, but is there a direct way?
2018-03-04 18:52:01	anon^_^	i think i misstated that then
2018-03-04 18:52:27	anon^_^	envoking one of these conditions (source.py | less, source.py | head -1, source.py | grep -q) triggers the error
2018-03-04 18:52:52	altendky	anon^_^: make a python script and a bash script that show the issue...
2018-03-04 18:53:04	anon^_^	i'm not a python programmer
2018-03-04 18:53:38	altendky	anon^_^: do you understand how it could be hard to debug a thing we know nothing about?
2018-03-04 18:53:52	anon^_^	hence linking the bug report, giving examples
2018-03-04 18:54:11	anon^_^	and suggesting you try it while piping output into one of those commands
2018-03-04 18:54:32	ali1234	oh i know this one
2018-03-04 18:54:42	ali1234	i had to deal with it once
2018-03-04 18:54:49	altendky	anon^_^: so which of the many snippets of code have you run yourself and had a problem with? Share that...
2018-03-04 18:55:49	anon^_^	altendky, if you don't know the answer, it would be better to just say that you can't help
2018-03-04 18:56:15	anon^_^	maybe someone else can
2018-03-04 18:56:57	altendky	anon^_^: how can I know the answer? You haven't specified a problem well. Just linked several different problems other people have. And if anyone else knew they would have jumped in.
2018-03-04 18:58:38	anon^_^	altendky, you didn't read any of the links
2018-03-04 18:58:45	anon^_^	it's a broken pipe issue
2018-03-04 18:59:51	ali1234	anon^_^: so this other SE question tells you how to fix it https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14207708/ioerror-errno-32-broken-pipe-python
2018-03-04 19:00:06	altendky	anon^_^: good deal. If you won't actually provide your issue you are having in your computer...
2018-03-04 19:00:19	ali1234	you can't modify the code, but can you add more code? import the code you want to run, and then catch the exception and ignore it
2018-03-04 19:00:32	anon^_^	yea ali1234 that's it
2018-03-04 19:00:42	anon^_^	the problem is that requires editing the source.py used
2018-03-04 19:01:00	ali1234	you just add another one and import whatever function you want to run from source.py
2018-03-04 19:01:03	anon^_^	i was hoping there was some other way around it
2018-03-04 19:01:05	ali1234	then run it
2018-03-04 19:01:14	ali1234	tada, you didn't have to edit source.py
2018-03-04 19:02:43	anon^_^	ali1234, i assume no workaround via commandline?
2018-03-04 19:02:56	anon^_^	option flag, or something else
2018-03-04 19:03:29	ali1234	well maybe you could -m the module that turns off sigpipe
2018-03-04 19:03:52	ali1234	not sure if -m can be used more than once, or with a specific script
2018-03-04 19:06:00	dtux	does urllib3 have anything to do with the stdlib urllibs (e.g. api compatibility, etc)?
2018-03-04 19:10:37	ali1234	anon^_^: i can't see a way to do it purely from the command line with python options
2018-03-04 19:11:07	anon^_^	ali1234, yeah that's kind of what i thought from reading the various stackexchange articles
2018-03-04 19:11:13	energizer	Anyone know how to get org-babel to use a specified virtualenv?
2018-03-04 19:11:16	anon^_^	all require editing the source.py
2018-03-04 19:11:31	ali1234	anon^_^: importing source.py works find though
2018-03-04 19:11:33	anon^_^	or piping output through a different linux command as a workaround
2018-03-04 19:11:43	altendky	anon^_^: why can't you modify the source?
2018-03-04 19:13:13	ali1234	anon^_^: http://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Bhn8HyjtWm/
2018-03-04 19:13:45	ali1234	anon^_^: python fix.py source.py | tee /dev/null
2018-03-04 19:14:01	ali1234	it works for the first test on the bug report
2018-03-04 19:14:29	ali1234	if your source.py is super complicated you might need more, but it's totally workable
2018-03-04 19:15:23	awygle	how can i get a dictionary key as a string in 3.6?
2018-03-04 19:15:35	ssbr	awygle: I don't understand the question.
2018-03-04 19:15:39	awygle	i am loading a yaml file and it starts with a root node that has a name, and i want to get that name
2018-03-04 19:15:46	ssbr	awygle: example input / output might be helpful.
2018-03-04 19:15:47	ali1234	anon^_^: theoretically you could stuff all that into -c argument, giving a pure command line solution
2018-03-04 19:15:57	awygle	{"TheName" : { a bunch of dicts }} and i want to get "TheName"
2018-03-04 19:16:11	ssbr	awygle: what if you have {"TheName": ..., "OtherName": ...} ?
2018-03-04 19:16:19	awygle	ssbr: but i don't, and won't
2018-03-04 19:16:37	awygle	i wanted to just do .keys()[0] but apparently dict_keys doesn't support indexing?
2018-03-04 19:17:04	ssbr	awygle: ((mykey, myvalue),) = mydict.items()
2018-03-04 19:17:18	energizer	awygle: you can make a list out of it
2018-03-04 19:17:21	energizer	list({'a':1, 'b':2}.keys())[0]
2018-03-04 19:17:23	streblo	i have a python script that i'd like to distribute as a mac/windows app, what's the best way to do this?
2018-03-04 19:17:25	ssbr	awygle: this will give a ValueError if the dict isn't exactly one entry
2018-03-04 19:17:42	awygle	ssbr: energizer: thanks
2018-03-04 19:17:50	energizer	awygle: ssbr's is better than mine
2018-03-04 19:18:09	anon^_^	ali1234, thanks
2018-03-04 19:18:20	ssbr	as an aside, it's only at times like these that I'm tempted to use [] for unpacking. [(a, b)] = c
2018-03-04 19:19:43	streblo	sounds like some people use py2app, others use pyinstaller, anyone had luck with these?
2018-03-04 19:20:56	ali1234	so does anyone know how to import a module when the source code is in a string?
2018-03-04 19:21:32	ali1234	i guess really it doesn't make sense due to relative imports and whatnot
2018-03-04 19:21:34	altendky	streblo: I use pyinstaller for windows
2018-03-04 19:21:36	ssbr	ali1234: that isn't possible without a lot of shenanigans. Why do you have code in a string?
2018-03-04 19:21:52	ali1234	ssbr: reasons
2018-03-04 19:22:19	altendky	ali1234: you can import from a file I think so I'd expect to be able to from a file like object
2018-03-04 19:22:56	altendky	Also, reasons is kind of a bad answer. Especially since they often end up being invalid reasons.
2018-03-04 19:24:02	ali1234	actually you're right
2018-03-04 19:24:48	ali1234	i should just save the source code to disk, and then have a systemd monitor the file for changes and run the saved source file
2018-03-04 19:24:52	ssbr	well, where I work, executing code from a string is straight up banned.

2018-03-04 19:51:11	bucketm0use	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/UhEBXLlJEkajsDbRwg52/ <-- How can I throw a 'ValueError' and skip 'else' if the 'try (line 11)' statement is not True?
2018-03-04 19:55:14	altendky	bucketm0use: assigning the result to a variable might be a first step
2018-03-04 19:56:43	nedbat	bucketm0use: why would line 11 raise a ValueError?
2018-03-04 19:57:04	bucketm0use	nedbat, I would expect the 'try' to fail and go to the error?
2018-03-04 19:57:20	nedbat	bucketm0use: i'm wondering why you even have the except on line 12.
2018-03-04 19:58:14	bucketm0use	nedbat, I want 'else' to only run if the len(a) == len(b)
2018-03-04 19:58:29	bucketm0use	altendky, the result of line 11?
2018-03-04 19:58:39	nedbat	bucketm0use: first, help me understand why there is an except on line 12 at all.  What is the try/except for?
2018-03-04 19:59:06	bucketm0use	nedbat, because my test suite is saying 'AssertionError: ValueError not raised'
2018-03-04 19:59:49	nedbat	bucketm0use: i don't think you are understanding my question.
2018-03-04 20:00:18	nedbat	bucketm0use: you should delete lines 10, 12,13, 14.  You don't need them.
2018-03-04 20:00:19	bucketm0use	nedbat, I imagine the 'except' is for when the 'try' returns 'False'?
2018-03-04 20:00:31	nedbat	bucketm0use: you imagine? Didn't you write this?
2018-03-04 20:00:45	bucketm0use	nedbat, I did; but there's a good chance I'm misunderstanding how 'try' works
2018-03-04 20:01:11	minn	you already 'know' that a and b are lists when len(a) == len(b) is executed - why are you expecting an exception to be raised?
2018-03-04 20:01:48	nedbat	bucketm0use: try/except is to handle problems that happen in the code.  Your line 11 can't raise a ValueError.
2018-03-04 20:07:41	nedbat	bucketm0use: it sounds like you want an if-statement:  if len(a) == len(b):
2018-03-04 20:08:40	bucketm0use	nedbat, thanks; is that instead of 'try'? so if--- else: except?
2018-03-04 20:09:02	nedbat	bucketm0use: if / else
2018-03-04 20:09:07	nedbat	bucketm0use: there's no except
2018-03-04 20:14:43	c4pt	hey I am having this weird problem
2018-03-04 20:14:51	c4pt	i am trying to modify a python irc bot
2018-03-04 20:15:16	c4pt	i am trying to have a line that read "self.ask('hello')"
2018-03-04 20:15:27	c4pt	i have two files irc.py and client.py
2018-03-04 20:15:37	c4pt	when i load client.py which contains self.ask it works fine
2018-03-04 20:15:51	c4pt	when i load irc.py and i have a line that says "import client"
2018-03-04 20:15:56	c4pt	when i run irc.py
2018-03-04 20:16:12	c4pt	I get NameError: name 'self' is not defined
2018-03-04 20:18:21	altendky	c4pt: gist full code and full output
2018-03-04 20:18:48	c4pt	altendky, i cant, its experimental and i dont want the code floating around
2018-03-04 20:19:14	c4pt	altendky, in my client.py i have this function
2018-03-04 20:19:17	c4pt	    def process_response(self, response):
2018-03-04 20:19:18	nedbat	c4pt: how can we help? You need to have self defined.
2018-03-04 20:19:26	nedbat	c4pt: don't put code here
2018-03-04 20:19:47	c4pt	nedbat, when I run client.py directly I can use self.ask no problem in client.py
2018-03-04 20:19:55	c4pt	nedbat, i have a second file called irc.py
2018-03-04 20:20:16	c4pt	nedbat, in irc.py at the top of the file i use "import client"       or "from client import *"
2018-03-04 20:20:22	nedbat	c4pt: the benefit you get from sharing the code now will far outweigh the cost of having it "floating around"
2018-03-04 20:20:34	c4pt	nedbat, in irc.py when i try to run the code using a line with self.ask       it cant find self.ask from client.py
2018-03-04 20:21:52	nedbat	c4pt: do you understand how classes work in python, and what self means?
2018-03-04 20:23:38	c4pt	nedbat, i am new to python but i have some experience with java i was thinking about maybe using Jython with this

2018-03-04 20:23:45	c4pt	nedbat, client.py has a Class
2018-03-04 20:23:59	c4pt	nedbat, irc.py does not have a Class or def
2018-03-04 20:24:18	nedbat	c4pt: these descriptions won't help us diagnose the problem
2018-03-04 20:24:21	c4pt	nedbat, i am trying to call "self.ask" from client.py where self.ask is defined
2018-03-04 20:24:49	newdimension	What is supposed to happen after I run this setup.py https://github.com/django-notifications/django-notifications/blob/master/setup.py ? I just see an egg under site-packages
2018-03-04 20:24:53	nedbat	tyoc213: you can install 3.7 alongside 2.7
2018-03-04 20:25:10	tyoc213	with the installer?
2018-03-04 20:25:17	nedbat	tyoc213: yes
2018-03-04 20:25:23	tyoc213	I thought I needed to do something like a virtual env or something along those lines
2018-03-04 20:25:28	tyoc213	ok, thx!
2018-03-04 20:26:42	nedbat	newdimension: you should be able to import the package now.
2018-03-04 20:26:52	bucketm0use	nedbat, https://i.imgur.com/7JbqB5e.png I cannot get the 'ValueError' to assert; am I missing something?
2018-03-04 20:26:55	nedbat	newdimension: though installing with pip is better than running setup.py
2018-03-04 20:28:27	nedbat	bucketm0use: can you show the output of running the tests?
2018-03-04 20:28:41	newdimension	nedbat: They haven't updated Pypi yet and I need their latest version. Is the package supposed to appear under site-packags?
2018-03-04 20:29:11	c4pt	nedbat, so how do i call something from a Class using import ?
2018-03-04 20:29:12	nedbat	newdimension: you can use pip to install things by file path also.  yes, it should be under site-packages
2018-03-04 20:29:14	bucketm0use	nedbat, the bottom-right pane is the output of the test suite (the 'raise ValueError' is breaking my test suite)
2018-03-04 20:29:16	c4pt	client.py uses a Class
2018-03-04 20:29:19	c4pt	irc.py doesnt
2018-03-04 20:29:31	c4pt	i want irc.py to call something out of the client.py Class
2018-03-04 20:29:43	nedbat	c4pt: from client import TheClass
2018-03-04 20:30:04	c4pt	ill try
2018-03-04 20:30:17	nedbat	bucketm0use: that doesn't look like a test runner output
2018-03-04 20:30:21	altendky	c4pt: unlike in Java, there is not a one to one relationship between files and classes. A class is a thing in a module. There is usually other stuff too
2018-03-04 20:30:59	newdimension	nedbat: It just added a .egg file there. https://dpaste.de/0yYZ
2018-03-04 20:31:14	c4pt	it doesnt find the class
2018-03-04 20:31:23	c4pt	when i use "from client import Client"
2018-03-04 20:31:24	tcpdump	Anyone have any recommendations for parsing xml?  Is there a module that's better than another?
2018-03-04 20:31:33	c4pt	where Client is the name of the Class in client.py
2018-03-04 20:31:51	c4pt	this is how client.py class looks
2018-03-04 20:31:51	nedbat	tcpdump: lxml
2018-03-04 20:31:52	c4pt	class Client(cmd.Cmd, object):
2018-03-04 20:32:13	nedbat	c4pt: if you can't pastebin the code, then we can't help.
2018-03-04 20:32:18	altendky	c4pt: client.py is a module, not a class
2018-03-04 20:32:34	bucketm0use	nedbat, https://i.imgur.com/ft1nRMw.png -- replaced 'raise ValueError' with 'print("ValueError") to show the test suite running.
2018-03-04 20:32:57	nedbat	bucketm0use: you should be able to get output like that even with the raise.
2018-03-04 20:33:37	nedbat	bucketm0use: change it back to raise, run the tests, and pastebin all of the text of the output
2018-03-04 20:33:43	tcpdump	So, I want to write a ballback server. Basically, it binds to a port, accepts xml via http, then stores the values.  I was trying to decided if I should simply use sockets, or if theres a better module for http?
2018-03-04 20:34:08	c4pt	altendky, so if i do "import client"
2018-03-04 20:34:13	c4pt	since client.py is a module
2018-03-04 20:34:27	c4pt	it will still not be able to call "self.ask" from client.py's Class
2018-03-04 20:34:50	bucketm0use	nedbat, like I said, having 'raise' is actually breaking the test suite: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/y4TuGVwLI42Nd1u3hx9t/
2018-03-04 20:34:52	grym	c4pt: `from client import Class; my_instance = Class(); myinstance.ask()`
2018-03-04 20:35:15	altendky	c4pt: there seem to be gaps in your understanding. You probably need a tutorial. Also, pastebin your code when you ask for help
2018-03-04 20:35:32	nedbat	bucketm0use: that's the entire output? Shouldn't it say some number of tests run, or something?
2018-03-04 20:35:39	bucketm0use	nedbat, correct
2018-03-04 20:35:48	bucketm0use	I'd expect the same, but alas..
2018-03-04 20:35:50	nedbat	bucketm0use: oh: you are calling distance at the top of the module: take that out
2018-03-04 20:36:10	c4pt	grym, doesnt find it
2018-03-04 20:36:10	kira0204	__getattr__  rewrites hasattr in python3.5 but not in 3.6, is that true?
2018-03-04 20:36:11	nedbat	bucketm0use: with that call there, you can't even import the file without an error
2018-03-04 20:36:35	c4pt	grym, client.py
2018-03-04 20:36:37	c4pt	class Client(cmd.Cmd, object):
2018-03-04 20:36:41	bucketm0use	nedbat, that was it https://paste.pound-python.org/show/7k7qwKpqh2CD6ZkMh5J7/ now I get actual errors
2018-03-04 20:36:44	grym	c4pt: don't paste code here :)
2018-03-04 20:36:51	c4pt	sorry
2018-03-04 20:36:53	nedbat	bucketm0use: great
2018-03-04 20:36:57	kira0204	And I know it's true, just verified it, can someone tell me why it's true
2018-03-04 20:37:00	grym	c4pt: but it would be `from client import Client` in that case
2018-03-04 20:37:09	c4pt	grym, i tried that also
2018-03-04 20:37:10	nedbat	kira0204: "rewrites"?
2018-03-04 20:37:12	c4pt	grym, tried both
2018-03-04 20:37:13	grym	c4pt: like altendky and nedbat have suggested, a tutorial seems in order for you
2018-03-04 20:37:23	nedbat	c4pt: or just show us your code, and we can help.
2018-03-04 20:42:12	bodangly	hey so I have a bit of a convoluted problem / question. I am writing a Flask app that uses Bitcoin via the Electrum wallet's python interface. I had the electrum wallet just running in Flask when I was using the dev server, but after switching to uWSGI with multiple processes, this is not viable as it seems when I do things to the data in the wallet, it doesn't traverse the various processes (makes sense of course)
2018-03-04 20:42:46	bodangly	So my thought was ok, what if I use Celery to talk to the wallet, and ONLY the celery worker is running the wallet code
2018-03-04 20:43:22	bodangly	but then, can my Flask app actually interact with the wallet object which would actually be running in the celery worker, not in the Flask app itself?
2018-03-04 20:43:45	kira0204	nedbat: Wait, sorry. I think I was wrong
2018-03-04 20:44:20	bodangly	so basically the celery worker passes a flag to create_app that starts up the wallet threads, and the main app doesn't, but then, is there a way to access that object which is only in the app context of the celery worker?
2018-03-04 20:45:20	bodangly	or should I scrap that entirely, run the wallet as its own standalone process, and use something like redis pub/sub to do async style function calls into the wallet?
2018-03-04 20:49:02	Indigoblue	Who here uses VIM as their main IDE/text editor?
2018-03-04 20:49:31	nedbat	Indigoblue: i do, and i don't have an completion in place.
2018-03-04 20:49:37	nedbat	*any completion
2018-03-04 20:52:50	Indigoblue	is there specific reason for that, other than *shrug* too much effort?
2018-03-04 20:53:16	monoprotic	nedbat: same
2018-03-04 20:53:24	Indigoblue	i'm considering making the switch from cloud9 to Linux + vim w/plugins
2018-03-04 20:54:12	nedbat	Indigoblue: completion in vim seems like it isn't up to the python challenge.  i could be wrong. I've just never been in the habit of using tab-completion.
2018-03-04 20:54:55	Indigoblue	nedbat: this seems to be a pretty good plugin for it - https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim
2018-03-04 20:55:05	nedbat	Indigoblue: could be
2018-03-04 20:55:11	grym	jedi-anything is usually pretty sane
2018-03-04 20:55:15	grym	it's a mature project
2018-03-04 20:55:17	Indigoblue	haven't tested it heavily yet, but based on what I could see so far, really useful
2018-03-04 20:55:18	nedbat	Indigoblue: there are a bunch that do it to varying degrees
2018-03-04 20:56:55	bodangly	Ingigoblue I use VIM exclusively but it took me a couple years to really get to the point where I prefer it over others
2018-03-04 20:58:33	bodangly	It started as just something to use when editing files remotely, but as I did so I started to find I loved how it worked, and I found myself remembering things better when I didn't have a fancy autocomplete or list of object attributes, etc. Of course those things can be bolted on to VIM too if wanted
2018-03-04 20:59:11	altendky	Also, some ide's provide vim modes
2018-03-04 20:59:15	bodangly	yeah
2018-03-04 20:59:32	bodangly	when I write C# .NET stuff for windows I use the VIM plugin in Visual Studio
2018-03-04 20:59:58	bodangly	and in all the JetBrains stuff though I really just use those for debuggers now and write most of the code in a CLI vim session
2018-03-04 21:01:21	bodangly	anyone have any experience with something similar to my issue with celery? Basically I want to run a background thread in a celery worker, and have call into that thread from a celery task. But I think I am probably thinking wrongly about this and hoping to abuse celery

2018-03-04 21:05:57	nedbat	charliemmann: who said it wasn't recognized?
2018-03-04 21:06:30	grym	kira0204: okay.  that seems like it should be fine
2018-03-04 21:06:43	charliemmann	when i execute it the second way, cathy and can run together, even though i put the space in the first set of string characters.
2018-03-04 21:07:34	nedbat	charliemmann: why would a space before the name make a space after the name?

2018-03-04 23:38:53	ssbr	`7hr34t_hvntr: generator expressions are not faster than list comprehensions or regular for loops.
2018-03-04 23:39:07	twb	The only other thing this app is doing that's unix-y is fcntl
2018-03-04 23:39:17	`7hr34t_hvntr	okay - so the most efficient way to go through them is basically a for loop
2018-03-04 23:39:24	twb	and https://docs.python.org/library/fcntl.html doesn't say "you idiot, just use library X instead of fcntl"
2018-03-04 23:39:29	ssbr	`7hr34t_hvntr: maybe it'd help to show what you're doing
2018-03-04 23:39:41	ssbr	`7hr34t_hvntr: but yeah, looping over a genexp that loops over a thing will be slower than just looping over a thing.
2018-03-04 23:39:50	ssbr	or at least, no faster.
2018-03-04 23:39:54	`7hr34t_hvntr	okay thanks

2018-03-05 15:27:27	AlexAltea	Not sure if there's an open issue about this, I searched and couldn't find anything:
2018-03-05 15:27:27	AlexAltea	Is it possible to mix big-endian / little-endian in struct.pack, struct.unpack, etc.? It doesn't seem to be the case.
2018-03-05 15:27:35	AlexAltea	Allowing formats like '>H<H' would be awesome:
2018-03-05 15:27:40	AlexAltea	1. You could easily do: struct.unpack('>H<H', b'\x01\x02\x01\x02) == (0x102, 0x201)
2018-03-05 15:27:48	AlexAltea	2. You could combine different structs by adding them. e.g.:
2018-03-05 15:27:48	AlexAltea	  fmt1, fmt2 = '>H', '<H'
2018-03-05 15:27:48	AlexAltea	  struct.calcsize(fmt1 + fmt2)  # struct.error: bad char in struct format
2018-03-05 15:27:48	AlexAltea	  struct.calcsize(fmt1) + struct.calcsize(fmt2) # works, but it's annoyingly verbose as the number of added formats goes up
2018-03-05 15:28:00	AlexAltea	> struct.calcsize(fmt1 + fmt2)
2018-03-05 15:28:07	AlexAltea	this would be so nice

2018-03-05 15:28:46	runciter	AlexAltea: what format mixes endianness?
2018-03-05 15:28:53	kur1j	Other than the unique constraint on my table that simply wouldn't allow SQLAlchemy to insert duplicates into the databas, is there a recommended way of having SQLAlchemy handle this?
2018-03-05 15:28:54	nedbat	AlexAltea: struct basically implements C struct semantics, so it doesn't surprise me that it can't mix.
2018-03-05 15:29:03	altendky	i'm starting a small python wrapper library for a jython library.  i am exposing a couple pieces i need via a cli.    how bad does it sound for the python library to provide a script which sets up a jython virtualenv inside the python library's site-packages directory?
2018-03-05 15:29:30	runciter	altendky: seems risky
2018-03-05 15:29:31	AlexAltea	runciter, well, even if it's the same endianness, adding formats doesn't work at the moment
2018-03-05 15:29:45	tech2	kur1j: why would you _not_ use a database constraint?
2018-03-05 15:29:49	runciter	AlexAltea: that's true - construct might help
2018-03-05 15:29:51	AlexAltea	I'm processing some headers that are made of different chunks depending on a version flag
2018-03-05 15:29:55	runciter	though they are breaking a lot of APIs these days
2018-03-05 15:30:08	AlexAltea	being able to add struct formats would help significantly

2018-03-05 15:30:25	altendky	runciter: suggested alternatives?  trying to figure out a way to not just have extra manual steps for my coworkers who mostly do embedded c.  it's for a python testing system for the c code.
2018-03-05 15:30:56	tech2	kur1j: well, yes, that's kinda the point.
2018-03-05 15:30:59	runciter	altendky: if it's for internal use only, and you can rely on jython (and the JVM, etc) being set up, it's less risky
2018-03-05 15:31:09	tech2	kur1j: What are you trying to achieve?
2018-03-05 15:31:11	energizer	tech2: as a practical matter, i can just ord() it and look it up
2018-03-05 15:31:24	AlexAltea	tos9, also sorry for pasting, I really hate when my IRC messages get scattered due to: X has joined / X has quit
2018-03-05 15:31:39	runciter	altendky: but then if you can rely on that, maybe it's better to set up the jython virtual env alongside your project's
2018-03-05 15:32:03	tech2	JJBby: line.lstrip() or line.strip() (to remove whitespace from both ends)
2018-03-05 15:32:07	tos9	AlexAltea: those of us who care don't see those joins + parts :)
2018-03-05 15:32:11	altendky	runciter: oh, sure.  it's not secret code but it's probably only going to be used internally and is exclusively for accessing a jython library (interface to ti's eclipse debugger).
2018-03-05 15:32:46	kur1j	tech2: I'm scanning a folder readings the list of files and inserting the metadata into a database (creation time, filename, full path, md5 hash of the file etc.). It will be ran every hour or so. The folder isn't purged so if there are 10k files in the folder and someone adds 1 file, there might 10k files in the database already and I only need to add that 1 file
2018-03-05 15:33:12	altendky	runciter: i was going to try pipenv for the regular cpython virtualenv and started trying to do pipenv for the jython as well but it doesn't work quite right and i'm feeling a bit disinterested at the moment in fixing it.
2018-03-05 15:33:13	runciter	altendky: then you can assume that it's available in a certain place (appdirs.user_data_dir("yourapp", ".jython-venv") maybe?) and invoke the code that way
2018-03-05 15:33:42	runciter	altendky: the more i think about it, the more i think my objection is to treating the jython virtualenv as something that should be put into site-packages
2018-03-05 15:33:55	JJBby	tech2, does that strip each just the first input or strips all of the different inputs in the file?
2018-03-05 15:34:00	runciter	altendky: since i'm guessing you generate it after installation instead of shipping it with your code
2018-03-05 15:34:04	runciter	(that would be possible but kind of hard)
2018-03-05 15:34:26	JJBby	tech2, also is that normal for a file to show that space? just trying to understand where its coming from thinking about it a bit deeper
2018-03-05 15:34:59	altendky	runciter: sure, that was what seemed kinda fishy.  and yes, the idea was to 'manually' call the script after installation.  also, this wouldn't be 'shipped' what with it being an internal testing tool effectively.  depends on thousands of dollars worth of hardware etc
2018-03-05 15:35:10	tech2	JJBby: it will strip from the beginning and end of whichever string you call it on. That space got into that file somehow, I don't know what created the file.
2018-03-05 15:35:52	altendky	runciter: if not inside the virtualenv i would put it somewhere in the c source tree that the tests are expected to live with
2018-03-05 15:36:00	runciter	altendky: hm, then i think i'd stick the jython venv into a directory via appdirs
2018-03-05 15:36:26	runciter	altendky: or if people use virtualenvwrapper, stick it in ~/.virtualenvs/
2018-03-05 15:36:50	altendky	runciter: hmmm :|
2018-03-05 15:36:56	runciter	or maybe even in dirname($VIRTUAL_ENV)
2018-03-05 15:37:03	altendky	runciter: not super excited about more complex mapping
2018-03-05 15:37:11	runciter	explain
2018-03-05 15:37:26	jwhisnant	runciter: would symlinks be better?
2018-03-05 15:37:39	runciter	the advantage to these is that they make the jython virtualenv look more and more like any other virtualenv
2018-03-05 15:37:41	JJBby	tech2, so if i understand what youre implying is that how ever i created the txt file there could be something with in that system thats adding a space? Takeaway is if each different way of making something can change the way the data is read it should just be stripped for consistency?
2018-03-05 15:37:53	altendky	runciter: say i have two clones of the c source.  i'd have to map from each one to it's virtualenv if the env isn't in a fixed place related to the c source.
2018-03-05 15:37:58	runciter	jwhisnant: hm, create the virtualenv in some directory and then symlink it into place?
2018-03-05 15:38:12	altendky	runciter: i was imagining it effectively being 'data' for the library which the library build after installation
2018-03-05 15:38:43	altendky	runciter: the developer would not be expected to interact with the jython env except to create it via this provided post-install script
2018-03-05 15:38:54	runciter	altendky: i'm dubious of putting the virtualenv into the c source directory; even with a gitignore, it'd be possible to check in a giant blob of crud
2018-03-05 15:38:59	runciter	or there'd be a risk fo it

2018-03-05 15:40:12	runciter	altendky: fair enough
2018-03-05 15:40:29	tech2	kur1j: which underlying database?
2018-03-05 15:40:39	altendky	runciter: conflicts in my desires don't please me
2018-03-05 15:40:43	_habnabit	altendky, sooooooo.. pipenv?
2018-03-05 15:40:45	runciter	altendky: i will say that something like ~/.local (or whatever appdirs ends up using) is a better place to put data generated after installation than a virtualenv's site-packages directory
2018-03-05 15:40:59	runciter	i would favor that after putting it where-ever other virtualenvs live
2018-03-05 15:41:02	altendky	_habnabit: yeah...  i started to make it work with jython and just got lazy.
2018-03-05 15:41:09	_habnabit	altendky, pipenv doesn't?
2018-03-05 15:41:22	runciter	jython isn't for humans
2018-03-05 15:41:29	_habnabit	ouch
2018-03-05 15:41:32	altendky	_habnabit: nope...  i mean it basically does except for https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/commit/8a3f1ed8a27da8820fba0fa4f72beb09a7844188
2018-03-05 15:41:39	runciter	_habnabit: everybody gets burned!
2018-03-05 15:41:49	altendky	_habnabit: and some followup where it assumes that the version in the pipfile is for python, not jython
2018-03-05 15:41:54	JJBby	tech2, ok, i beleive we are on similiar pages. Ill look at some examples to figure out some best practices for stripping. I beleive ill learn about being strict soon(going through classes). So thank you!
2018-03-05 15:42:04	_habnabit	altendky, erm, pipenv --python=jython ?
2018-03-05 15:42:12	altendky	runciter: hence my attempt to reveal a cli from it and nothing more.
2018-03-05 15:42:45	altendky	_habnabit: i didn't use the equals, but yes.  note my commit that makes it bother to search the path when you specify jython.  otherwise it just won't find 'jython'.
2018-03-05 15:42:54	altendky	_habnabit: and there are other issues after that (or with a full path)
2018-03-05 15:43:14	altendky	_habnabit: there's 'python' hardcoded in various places that would have to become a bit more general
2018-03-05 15:43:31	_habnabit	altendky, and it doesn't symlink jython to python?
2018-03-05 15:43:40	_habnabit	altendky, i figured virtualenv would do that
2018-03-05 15:44:23	kur1j	tech2: postgresql
2018-03-05 15:44:29	altendky	_habnabit: let me check, but at least it would need to store 'jython' somewhere to know to use jython next time it builds the env.
2018-03-05 15:44:58	tech2	kur1j: would merging work in your case? http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/session_state_management.html#merging
2018-03-05 15:46:12	altendky	_habnabit: i'm also not the happiest about there not being a pipenv correlary to extras_require
2018-03-05 15:46:24	altendky	_habnabit: --dev was pointed out but that's a fixed two-mode option
2018-03-05 15:46:57	kur1j	tech2: I'm using a surrogate key for this table and wanting to check against the md5
2018-03-05 15:47:02	kur1j	so I don't think it would work
2018-03-05 15:47:09	tech2	kur1j: Otherwise you might want to look at INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY IGNORE (and sqlalchemy supports it, I just forget how)
2018-03-05 15:47:34	kur1j	tech2: so basically doing a raw INSERT?
2018-03-05 15:47:52	altendky	_habnabit: yes, there is a python->jython symlink in the create virtualenv.  but, the concept of not-python pythons would still have to be built into the config file and used when creating a fresh environment
2018-03-05 15:47:56	tech2	no, you can do it via core, not sure about how with the ORM though
2018-03-05 15:48:55	disi	thoughts on using disutils.version vs [int(x) for x in version.split('.')] ?
2018-03-05 15:49:39	kur1j	tech2: what do you mean by core?
2018-03-05 15:50:32	altendky	runciter: i think i'm trying to be lazy about keeping track of a location in ~/.virtualenvs that the cpython env needs to reference for the jython env.  also, cleanup issues when you're done with it.  is there not an inside-the-env place for library data?  virtualenv gets us an isolated environment...  but we have to store data globally?
2018-03-05 15:50:40	patarr	Hello. Is there any way to package in all python dependencies with an application to ship to a server?
2018-03-05 15:50:50	nedbat	patarr: look at pex
2018-03-05 15:51:17	tech2	kur1j: sqlalchemy.core, the SQL part of SQLAlchemy
2018-03-05 15:52:01	tech2	kur1j: you could use the unique object pattern - https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/wiki/UsageRecipes/UniqueObject - not sure how old that idea is. The problem is that you have a table with technically two keys, the unique column, and the pk
2018-03-05 15:52:33	kur1j	tech2: yeah, I'm debating on if I should change that or not honestly
2018-03-05 15:53:00	tech2	If you made the unique column the pk then merge would work
2018-03-05 15:53:13	kur1j	yeah
2018-03-05 15:53:30	kur1j	thats what I'm seeing, just not sure if thats worth doing that and what I would end up screwing up elsewhere
2018-03-05 15:54:45	JeffATL	how common is it for python "major dudes" to code in something like jupyter notebook?
2018-03-05 15:54:59	runciter	popular
2018-03-05 15:55:05	runciter	or common, i guess
2018-03-05 15:55:33	runciter	jupyter is useful
2018-03-05 15:55:35	energizer	JeffATL: depends on the type of code. datasci do it a lot.
2018-03-05 15:55:46	JeffATL	runciter: i didn't know if maybe it were kind of training wheels
2018-03-05 15:55:54	JeffATL	energizer: ah okay
2018-03-05 15:55:59	runciter	i know somebody who publishes internal API documentation as ipython notebooks
2018-03-05 15:56:09	runciter	peter norvig uses them to explain concepts
2018-03-05 15:56:13	SnoopJeDi	Jupyter is very common, particularly for exploratory code, or if you want to construct a narrative (plots, prose, equations)
2018-03-05 15:56:23	runciter	https://github.com/norvig/pytudes
2018-03-05 15:56:24	tech2	JeffATL: it's very useful for presentation, or combined presentation and documentation. It's not as useful/normal for something like service development though, no.
2018-03-05 15:56:34	JeffATL	okay, so it's reasonable to have that available for serious devops
2018-03-05 15:56:49	runciter	JeffATL: yes, the person i'm thinking of is in devops
2018-03-05 15:57:03	runciter	i believe they even include ipython notebooks in tickets so people can reproduce issues
2018-03-05 15:57:03	SnoopJeDi	It's kinda nice to be able to prototype things in Jupyter, but you could do basically the same thing in the IPython console, the browser interface is just a nice bonus :)
2018-03-05 15:57:26	energizer	yeah its good for "literate programming", i wouldn't use it for code that has to change often, for the same reason as "comments are lies"
2018-03-05 15:57:38	JeffATL	energizer: heh
2018-03-05 15:57:39	runciter	energizer: :+1:
2018-03-05 15:58:18	grym	runciter: i've been using org-mode to similar effect, of late
2018-03-05 15:58:22	DaPinkOne	i've never heard "comments are lies" before. that's kindof funny.
2018-03-05 15:58:35	tech2	true though :/
2018-03-05 15:58:46	Habbie	the problem with comments is that the compiler does not read them
2018-03-05 15:58:58	JeffATL	energizer: heh
2018-03-05 15:59:10	SnoopJeDi	I find myself writing the early versions of classes in my notebooks and then pulling them into a module once they've got enough polish
2018-03-05 15:59:39	jwhisnant	altendky: sys.executable ? (although is may just be /path/to/venv/python (and not jython) ) sys.copyright? (I don't like it)
2018-03-05 16:00:02	altendky	jwhisnant: hmm?
2018-03-05 16:00:07	runciter	grym: oooh with capturing?
2018-03-05 16:00:20	runciter	grym: i am thinking about moving everything into emacs just for that
2018-03-05 16:00:38	grym	runciter: yeah.  http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html  down the rabbit hole you go :)
2018-03-05 16:00:44	runciter	grym: !
2018-03-05 16:00:48	runciter	grym: ty :)
2018-03-05 16:00:49	energizer	I've been enjoying writing my code in a .py that's _backed_ by a jupyter kernel and have the output appear inline, so I can work in my preferred editor and get the bonus of jupyter images etc
2018-03-05 16:01:05	_habnabit	kur1j, also don't use md5
2018-03-05 16:01:05	grym	runciter: sure thing!  org-mode is basically "what markdown or jupyter would be, if leslie lamport wrote it"
2018-03-05 16:01:09	energizer	and then when im done i have the .py already there
2018-03-05 16:01:26	grym	energizer: bingo.  i do this with autoreload magic, but the effect is similar
2018-03-05 16:02:00	kur1j	_habnabit: ?
2018-03-05 16:02:17	_habnabit	kur1j, you're hashing with md5
2018-03-05 16:03:12	foo	What's strange is I passed source code from 11,000 pages through this function: https://paste.ofcode.org/HvrSb9sL5KFhQ3WwAjTpRD - which strips html/javascript/styling from the source code. I would have expected it to shrink my table size. Instead, it increased it by 40MB
2018-03-05 16:03:17	kur1j	_habnabit: yeah files just to check if they are unique
2018-03-05 16:03:19	energizer	grym: ipython %autoreload?
2018-03-05 16:03:25	SnoopJeDi	I flirted with Atom's Hydrogen plugin for a while, but I think I just don't care enough, since vim-mode works pretty well in Jupyter :)
2018-03-05 16:03:37	_habnabit	kur1j, oh, sure, so use a real hash like blake2
2018-03-05 16:03:46	energizer	SnoopJeDi: yeah i used that a bunch and liked it
2018-03-05 16:03:51	altendky	so aside from my data being a virtualenv...  virtualenvs nicely isolate our code, but do they really not provide an appropriate place for an isolated package to store it's data in isolation?
2018-03-05 16:04:20	grym	energizer: right; i'll do that for a package that i have open in pycharm and installed in a venv.  then launch jupyter from the same venv, hack around, spit out graphs, etc, make PDF, hand to boss, profit.
2018-03-05 16:04:21	foo	Maybe it's the newlines
2018-03-05 16:05:39	_habnabit	kur1j, md5 is very much obsolete
2018-03-05 16:05:54	tech2	even sha256 and the file-size would be better
2018-03-05 16:07:20	kur1j	well the problem with ththem are they just are a pain to store
2018-03-05 16:07:30	▷	grym remembers reading this thread on slashdot in about 1998 
2018-03-05 16:07:34	⚡	firas_ is now known as firas
2018-03-05 16:07:43	_habnabit	kur1j, the problem with what?
2018-03-05 16:07:48	jwhisnant	altendky: I was trying to answer "what is the python implementation" in a particular virtualenv. sys.executable reports '/tmp/jy/bin/jython' for me.
2018-03-05 16:08:15	jwhisnant	(but maybe I don't understand the question)
2018-03-05 16:08:18	kur1j	_habnabit: md5 fits nicely into a uuid
2018-03-05 16:08:38	_habnabit	kur1j, that is a silly hack and you can get a blake2 hash of that length anyway
2018-03-05 16:08:48	altendky	jwhisnant: ah, sure.  what i've got is a library that will be installed into both a cpython virtualenv and a jython virtualenv.  the imported api in the cpython side will subprocess to the jython side.
2018-03-05 16:08:55	_habnabit	kur1j, you can even truncate a sha256 hash, but blake2 is nice
2018-03-05 16:09:02	ali1234	why would someone write "return (yield from x)"?
2018-03-05 16:09:06	altendky	jwhisnant: basically trying to expose a little bit of a jython lib to my cpython tests
2018-03-05 16:09:13	_habnabit	ali1234, why not
2018-03-05 16:09:14	kur1j	_habnabit: what would you store it as then?
2018-03-05 16:09:29	_habnabit	kur1j, a blob or the hex bytes as text
2018-03-05 16:09:53	_habnabit	kur1j, anyway, there is literally no reason to use md5 in 2018
2018-03-05 16:10:17	ali1234	_habnabit: well if you can yield from x, why not just return x?
2018-03-05 16:10:31	_habnabit	ali1234, because 'yield from x' can return a value that isn't x
2018-03-05 16:10:51	ali1234	right
2018-03-05 16:11:08	ali1234	let me put it another way
2018-03-05 16:11:25	ali1234	what's the difference between (yield from x) and (yield from (yield from x))?
2018-03-05 16:11:47	ali1234	you get a different value, but if you yield from it you get the same things
2018-03-05 16:11:49	_habnabit	ali1234, well, `yield from x` can return a value that doesn't return itself when yielded from
2018-03-05 16:12:58	ali1234	can you give an example?
2018-03-05 16:13:05	tech2	kur1j: also, please don't abuse a uuid field for non-uuid data :(
2018-03-05 16:13:22	_habnabit	tech2, it's a """common idiom""" for mysql users to store md5 as uuids
2018-03-05 16:13:30	_habnabit	tech2, because it's 'convenient'
2018-03-05 16:14:10	_habnabit	ali1234, ok, so, maybe we should take a step back and talk about what the expression `yield from x` evaluates to. so you know about StopIteration, right?
2018-03-05 16:14:13	tech2	_habnabit: also, silly.
2018-03-05 16:14:17	_habnabit	tech2, quite
2018-03-05 16:14:40	ali1234	yes
2018-03-05 16:15:11	_habnabit	ali1234, when `next(x)` raises StopIteration(y), `yield from x` evaluates to y
2018-03-05 16:15:27	kur1j	tech2: https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/115271/what-is-the-optimal-data-type-for-an-md5-field
2018-03-05 16:15:55	kur1j	tech2: that is what I was referencing for that
2018-03-05 16:16:02	ali1234	okay
2018-03-05 16:16:07	_habnabit	kur1j, this is so silly
2018-03-05 16:16:31	kur1j	was just looking at the suggestions on how to store it and thats what I ran across
2018-03-05 16:16:33	kur1j	seemed reasonable
2018-03-05 16:16:47	_habnabit	kur1j, it's a moot point because nobody should be using md5 :)
2018-03-05 16:16:58	disi	how do i make mypy find my installed python modules?
2018-03-05 16:17:12	disi	(in tox, fwiw)
2018-03-05 16:17:58	ali1234	_habnabit: so ... then what?
2018-03-05 16:18:30	_habnabit	ali1234, i don't know what to say. any given x can raise StopIteration with some arbitrary other y
2018-03-05 16:21:50	energizer	ali1234: try this https://ptpb.pw/DcSz/python
2018-03-05 16:22:27	energizer	ali1234: better https://ptpb.pw/kYcs/python
2018-03-05 16:23:08	ali1234	that still has syntax errors :(
2018-03-05 16:23:14	energizer	ali1234: python 3.6
2018-03-05 16:23:33	ali1234	i only have 3.5
2018-03-05 16:24:05	kur1j	_habnabit: any recommendation for size of hash with blake2? I'm just really wanting to make sure its not a duplicate
2018-03-05 16:24:48	energizer	ali1234: this should work in 3.5 https://ptpb.pw/DRD3/python
2018-03-05 16:25:08	ali1234	got it
2018-03-05 16:25:13	_habnabit	kur1j, well, i tend to default to 256 bits, but there's ways to calculate an approximate lower bound on hash length given the expected cardinality of your set of files
2018-03-05 16:25:16	ali1234	that new format syntax looks nice
2018-03-05 16:25:23	energizer	ali1234: yep :)
2018-03-05 16:25:26	ali1234	anyway...
2018-03-05 16:26:37	grym	ali1234: upgrading is easy... :-)
2018-03-05 16:26:46	ali1234	energizer: so i guess my question is, what's the point of that?
2018-03-05 16:27:20	energizer	ali1234: do you see the differnece between a subgenerator that returns and one that does `yield from`?
2018-03-05 16:27:25	ali1234	yes
2018-03-05 16:28:15	ali1234	i was confused because i thought that return (yield from x) was the same as return (y for y in x)
2018-03-05 16:28:35	patarr	nedbat: does pex require an internet connection to acquire dependencies when first ran?
2018-03-05 16:28:39	ali1234	but that would of course serve no purpose
2018-03-05 16:28:41	patarr	Meaning the deployed artifact. Not the pex build process.
2018-03-05 16:28:42	energizer	patarr: yes
2018-03-05 16:28:51	energizer	patarr: no
2018-03-05 16:29:00	ali1234	i can see that return (yield from x) does in fact do *something*, but i am still not sure why i would want it
2018-03-05 16:29:00	patarr	energizer: I need some disambiguation :D lol
2018-03-05 16:29:27	energizer	patarr: the deployed artifact contains its dependencies already, doesnt need internet to get them
2018-03-05 16:30:25	patarr	energizer: thanks! Does it have any incurred runtime cost?
2018-03-05 16:30:32	Hell-Razor	Well that assignment turned out to be a disaster
2018-03-05 16:30:36	energizer	patarr: relative to?
2018-03-05 16:31:00	patarr	energizer: typical set up. Whether it be global site-packages or virtual env packages.
2018-03-05 16:32:02	energizer	ali1234: this is 3.6, so you can get that version or try it on repl.it https://ptpb.pw/kQND/python
2018-03-05 16:32:28	ali1234	energizer: it seems incomplete
2018-03-05 16:32:30	energizer	patarr: idk. i imagine it'd be small potatoes though
2018-03-05 16:32:37	energizer	ali1234: ?
2018-03-05 16:33:04	energizer	ali1234: oh you're right, sorry
2018-03-05 16:33:32	energizer	ali1234: https://ptpb.pw/O87q/python
2018-03-05 16:34:25	ali1234	okay, you're getting hung up on my misunderstand.
2018-03-05 16:35:03	energizer	ali1234: the point of that last addition is that `return (yield from g)` is _not_ the same as `return (x for x in g)`
2018-03-05 16:35:14	ali1234	yeah, i know that
2018-03-05 16:35:39	minus	generators confuse the fuck out of me; when you return in them the return value just disappears. but not always
2018-03-05 16:36:16	energizer	minus: fwiw we try to keep the channel family-friendly
2018-03-05 16:37:24	minus	you can't talk about programming without swearing tho
2018-03-05 16:38:00	ali1234	anyway my question is, how is this useful in a real program?
2018-03-05 16:38:04	Hell-Razor	disi: Sorry should have messaged you in here
2018-03-05 16:38:57	_habnabit	ali1234, 'yield from' is the basis for some coroutine systems. the individual yields are implementation details and the yield from result is the thing you care about
2018-03-05 16:39:41	ali1234	so it's for complicated stuff i hope i never have to see?
2018-03-05 16:40:15	energizer	ali1234: see beazley's talks
2018-03-05 16:40:46	_habnabit	ali1234, well.. if you have >1 'yield from' in a function, you can't do `return x` with the same semantics as `return (yield from x)`
2018-03-05 16:41:21	ali1234	true but you can only return once from a function
2018-03-05 16:41:37	ali1234	you can't return (yield from x) more than once. or can you?
2018-03-05 16:41:45	ali1234	i don't even know any more :(
2018-03-05 16:42:06	energizer	_habnabit: iirc you and runciter recently were speaking against a certain coroutine api or design but i didnt quite get it, do you recall what this was?
2018-03-05 16:42:12	_habnabit	ali1234, no, what i'm saying is that `def f(): yield from x; return y` is not the same as `def f(): yield from x; return (yield from y)`
2018-03-05 16:42:25	_habnabit	energizer, asyncio's?
2018-03-05 16:42:37	ali1234	_habnabit: i never thought that was the case
2018-03-05 16:42:44	energizer	_habnabit: lemme see if i can find the message
2018-03-05 16:43:09	_habnabit	ali1234, i don't know what your confusion is then
2018-03-05 16:46:11	energizer	_habnabit: <_habnabit> i very strongly dislike the pattern `async def do_a_loop(x): while True: x = await x.read()` <_habnabit> vs. `def data_received(x):`
2018-03-05 16:46:43	energizer	_habnabit: is that saying you prefer callbacks over coroutines?
2018-03-05 16:47:51	_habnabit	energizer, no. i'm saying that i want something external driving my IO
2018-03-05 16:48:05	_habnabit	energizer, tubes does this without callbacks
2018-03-05 16:48:25	courrier	I'm sending network data to devices from a computer that has 2 network interfaces, the first in 2.0.0.X, second in 192.168.1.X.
2018-03-05 16:48:25	courrier	I want to transmit broadcast data to all 2.0.0.X devices, but sock.sendto only works with "<broadcast>" which also floods network 192.168.1.X
2018-03-05 16:48:25	courrier	Why doesn't my first attempt send broacast data to 2.0.0.X only correctly? See http://paste.debian.net/1013276/
2018-03-05 16:48:34	ali1234	_habnabit: my confusion came from the fact that 'return (y for y in x)' is pretty much the same as 'return x'. i now see that 'return (yield from x)' is not equivalent to either of those
2018-03-05 16:49:43	_habnabit	ali1234, okay. so you're no longer confused?
2018-03-05 16:49:50	ali1234	_habnabit: but, although i now know what it does, i can't think of a reason why i would ever use it
2018-03-05 16:50:12	_habnabit	ali1234, what about my example function?
2018-03-05 16:51:06	ali1234	what about it? just because you can write a function with some specific behaviour does not mean it is actually useful :)
2018-03-05 16:51:27	_habnabit	ali1234, it's common in async systems
2018-03-05 16:52:19	ali1234	it seems like my confusion comes ultimately from yield being used in two different ways: to make generators, and to make a function... well, yield to other coroutines
2018-03-05 16:53:00	_habnabit	ali1234, it's true. that's part of why 'await' got introduced: the 'yield from' semantics are confusing
2018-03-05 16:53:13	_habnabit	ali1234, 'await' also has confusing semantics but it's at least slightly less confusing lexically
2018-03-05 16:54:19	energizer	_habnabit: tubes looks interesting, thanks
2018-03-05 16:55:20	ali1234	it feels like yield was invented for generators and then someone said "hey we can implement concurrency with this :)"
2018-03-05 16:55:51	energizer	ali1234: yeah i think thats what happened
2018-03-05 16:56:37	ali1234	with that in mind, is there any example where "return (yield from x)" is useful besides concurrency?
2018-03-05 16:56:44	KirkMcDonald	ali1234: A generator is just a stack frame whose execution has been suspended.
2018-03-05 16:56:57	KirkMcDonald	Which is basically what a coroutine is.
2018-03-05 16:57:05	energizer	i think i'd prefer if there were separate def,gen,coro keywords
2018-03-05 16:57:40	energizer	but the decorators arent bad
2018-03-05 16:58:00	grym	ali1234: i believe that's the literal truth
2018-03-05 16:59:10	meejah	my understanding is that "async def" and "await" are literally just sugar on top of generator/yield .. but perhaps I'm wrong about that?
2018-03-05 16:59:36	SpeakerToMeat	Hi all.
2018-03-05 16:59:59	grym	meejah: i think that was true once, and it probably still is? i have some hazy memories from a dabeaz keynote to that effect
2018-03-05 17:00:15	SpeakerToMeat	Question, I'm testing a sample gui (gtk) for python-vlc to see how it works, and it's doingfrom evaluator import Evaluator which I can't find, and I can't find on pypi... any idea what module is this?
2018-03-05 17:00:17	energizer	meejah: there's a semantic difference, so you can't await the same things you can yield from, its supposed to be a clean separation
2018-03-05 17:02:51	meejah	energizer: yeah, that constantly bites me when I do "async def foo()" and then have a "yield" in it, so now I've made an "async generator" that'll never run ;)
2018-03-05 17:03:19	energizer	SpeakerToMeat: thats weird https://github.com/oaubert/python-vlc/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=evaluator&type=
2018-03-05 17:03:34	meejah	..but I was speaking about "under the hood"
2018-03-05 17:03:53	energizer	meejah: yeah i think that's basically right
2018-03-05 17:04:00	meejah	grym: all my memories of dabeaz keynotes get hazy ;)
2018-03-05 17:04:10	AlexCDev	Hi all, I'm using numpy and I can't seem to get list.append to work :/
2018-03-05 17:04:26	grym	AlexCDev: post code
2018-03-05 17:04:28	AlexCDev	Can someone give me some pointers as to why this behaviour is happening
2018-03-05 17:04:28	AlexCDev	https://paste.debian.net/1013277/
2018-03-05 17:04:30	AlexCDev	cheers
2018-03-05 17:04:42	SpeakerToMeat	energizer: Yeah
2018-03-05 17:04:54	SpeakerToMeat	energizer: And it's not part of the python-vlc package
2018-03-05 17:04:59	AlexCDev	Excuse the variable names, our professor is insisting that we use these :/
2018-03-05 17:05:24	energizer	AlexCDev: drop list()
2018-03-05 17:05:42	grym	AlexCDev: it's possible that transpose is returning a view not a copy
2018-03-05 17:06:14	sigdk	for key in survey.jsonContent.keys(): print(key) --> prints "Response". how can I refer to the Response node?  print(survey["Response"]) says "TypeError: 'Survey' object is not subscriptable"
2018-03-05 17:06:38	AlexCDev	energizer, I'll give that a try
2018-03-05 17:06:59	energizer	np.transpose definitely returns a new one
2018-03-05 17:07:08	AlexCDev	grym, according to the docs "returns a view when possible"
2018-03-05 17:07:17	AlexCDev	(for np.transpose)
2018-03-05 17:07:57	grym	AlexCDev: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/7iTrtN28e04CGUzmss8F/  works for me  though
2018-03-05 17:08:03	energizer	uh scratch that heh
2018-03-05 17:09:14	AlexCDev	Gonna have another go grym
2018-03-05 17:11:44	SnoopJeDi	AlexCDev, append() is usually an antipattern with numpy. If you can prefill a structure with sentinel values (np.nan works well), it's a LOT better for a variety of reasons.
2018-03-05 17:11:58	grym	^ yeah, x should be a ndarray
2018-03-05 17:12:37	SnoopJeDi	np.full(), np.eye(), np.ones(), np.zeroes() are helpful functions along that line
2018-03-05 17:13:12	v1nce	any indie hackers here? :)
2018-03-05 17:13:16	energizer	i always forget about np.full, thats useful
2018-03-05 17:13:59	rindolf	Hi all! I tried web searching but  to no avail - how do I call a python subroutine from JS when using pyjs?
2018-03-05 17:14:24	SnoopJeDi	It's really helpful IME when you have data whose length in a certain dimension may change (in my case, particles deleted from a simulation, so Npart is not constant)
2018-03-05 17:15:13	AlexCDev	cheers SnoopJeDi, grym, energizer
2018-03-05 17:15:14	energizer	ya
2018-03-05 17:16:12	ali1234	so about yield from... how do i complete this piece of code? https://paste.pound-python.org/show/ukGhQ5nmtRkgSnaogBZB/
2018-03-05 17:19:10	energizer	ali1234: its too late at that point, its already yielded
2018-03-05 17:19:35	ali1234	energizer: so then how do i implement bar()?
2018-03-05 17:20:14	ali1234	call next() myself until i get the exception?
2018-03-05 17:20:16	ramsub07	Hi i've started the flask server. but when i try to visit the homepage, I get 404 error. I'm not sure how to debug that. Sorry about the very less information, I'm not sure how to be more descriptive
2018-03-05 17:21:03	DaPinkOne	ramsub07: does the server log have anything?
2018-03-05 17:21:34	ramsub07	DaPinkOne: there is server.log file, but it's empty
2018-03-05 17:22:06	DaPinkOne	ramsub07: that's strange. there should be a log if you've connected.
2018-03-05 17:22:27	energizer	ali1234: yeah that'll work
2018-03-05 17:22:52	ramsub07	DaPinkOne: the only thing i see are errors on commandline
2018-03-05 17:23:03	DaPinkOne	ramsub07: well, what you got there?
2018-03-05 17:23:21	ramsub07	"GET / HTTP/1.1" 404 -
2018-03-05 17:24:41	DaPinkOne	perhaps some bug with your code?
2018-03-05 17:25:03	DaPinkOne	or the server might have the wrong directory? i'm not sure how flask/yoursetup work
2018-03-05 17:25:18	ramsub07	DaPinkOne: how to figure out?
2018-03-05 17:26:57	DaPinkOne	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11024374/why-am-i-getting-404-error-in-flask some googling?
2018-03-05 17:26:57	h4k1m	Hi, why doesn't `'aa:bb'.lstrip(':')` result in 'bb', and returns instead the string as it was given?

2018-03-05 18:30:56	SlowBait	Hi, I need to have an object that behaves like a primitive type (dict, for example) but has extra attributes. Is it pythonic to subclass it and add the attributes in there?
2018-03-05 18:32:21	Yhg1s	SlowBait: it depends. What do you want, for example, the 'copy' method to return?
2018-03-05 18:32:54	nedbat	SlowBait: often, it only needs to act like the dict in one small way, and you can add that to your own class instead of subclassing
2018-03-05 18:33:12	Yhg1s	SlowBait: it's usually a mistake to subclass builtin types, because you can't always get the answer to those kinds of questions that you want. For something like dict, use collections.MutableMapping instead. It's a bit more work, but a lot more predictable.
2018-03-05 18:34:27	SlowBait	What I have is a parser, and it returns a dict (whose entries are strings, lists, ints and so on). I'd like to retain the ability to treat those as regular strings, lists and ints, but add some metadata to them (position where they come from in the file, for example).
2018-03-05 18:35:20	Yhg1s	SlowBait: for strings and ints it's even harder to subclass correctly, or add metdata to them, really. Acting exactly like strings and ints is also a difficult thing to do.
2018-03-05 18:35:45	Yhg1s	SlowBait: do you want to add the metadata to the strings/lists/ints themselves, or to the dict?
2018-03-05 18:36:21	SlowBait	strings/lists/ints/dicts part of the big dict
2018-03-05 18:36:41	nedbat	SlowBait: it might be easier to turn a string into a tuple of (str, metadata) instead
2018-03-05 18:36:47	BPL	i don't understand... why is id(global_var) different when doing a) from a.b.c import global_var than b) from c import global_var ? :/ , anyone knows how to make global_var a proper instance to be shared between modules?
2018-03-05 18:37:10	Yhg1s	SlowBait: well, they're never 'part of the dict'. They don't know they're in a dict. Everything in Python is a reference, so the dict just has references to them. Do you want to be able to access the metadata from the objects, or from the dict?
2018-03-05 18:37:29	Brondius	Newb to python doing automatetheboringstuff: I'm using pyautogui to locateOnScreen an image that I snipped from the screen but it always says the image doesn't exist on the screen. Any ideas as to why?
2018-03-05 18:37:36	Hell-Razor	Alright I am back
2018-03-05 18:37:43	Yhg1s	BPL: if it's different, it's because a.b.c isn't c. Probably because you're mixing relative and absolute imports and/or are running something that lives inside a package and/or messing with sys.path/PYTHONPATH.
2018-03-05 18:37:55	SlowBait	Ah, from the dict.
2018-03-05 18:38:46	SlowBait	I'd always say d['a']['b']['c'].metadata
2018-03-05 18:38:55	BPL	Yhg1s: The absolute path of c.py is the same in both cases, and PYTHONPATH, i'm just using pth files on my virtualenv
2018-03-05 18:38:56	Yhg1s	SlowBait: then probably the easiest thing would be to make the values in the dict be a tuple of the item and its metadata, or to have parallel dicts (or a dict-like object, a MutableMapping subclass that stores the tuples but gives you either the item or the metadata depending on how you access it.)
2018-03-05 18:39:16	Yhg1s	SlowBait: that isn't from the dict, no.
2018-03-05 18:39:24	Yhg1s	SlowBait: assuming d['a']['b']['c'] is the item.
2018-03-05 18:39:45	⚡	McKraken_zzzzz is now known as McKraken
2018-03-05 18:40:13	Yhg1s	BPL: the path of c.py doesn't matter, what matters is how it is imported. Add something like 'print("importing c.py as", __name__)' to c.py and see what output you get. If you're importing it in mlutiple ways, you'll see it print that multipe times with different names.
2018-03-05 18:40:16	SlowBait	Your suggestion would be something like d.metadata['a']['b']['c']?
2018-03-05 18:40:17	Hell-Razor	So if subprocess.check_output returns an error, is there a way to say ignore it and still write to the file?
2018-03-05 18:41:07	Yhg1s	SlowBait: not as such, because in d['a']['b']['c'], 'd' only knows about 'a'. It has no idea about 'b' and 'c'.  So more like d['a']['b'].get_metadata('c').
2018-03-05 18:41:30	Yhg1s	SlowBait: unless you want to change 'd' to not be a nested dict, so it'd just be d['a', 'b', 'c'] and d.get_metadata('a', 'b', 'c'), for example.
2018-03-05 18:42:23	Hell-Razor	Woh
2018-03-05 18:42:29	Hell-Razor	Whatever I did it locked the machine up
2018-03-05 18:45:16	SlowBait	Yhg1s: Ok, so I'd parse things normally, except that dicts would be a custom class inheriting from MutableMapping with a get_metadata method that'd return the metadata for each entry.
2018-03-05 18:45:23	achillion	Hell-Razor: you can catch CalledProcessError or use something else (like run())
2018-03-05 18:46:03	Hell-Razor	achillion: i never have used anything like that. Ill have to look into it
2018-03-05 18:46:22	achillion	not sure what you mean by "write to the file", I assume that has to do with the command you're shelling out to
2018-03-05 18:47:51	Hell-Razor	subprocess.check_output(['curl', '-k', '-XGET', 'http://xxxxxxxxxxx', '-d', json.dumps(data),querDir+"results"+fleNames]) crashed my vm lol
2018-03-05 18:47:53	Hell-Razor	interesting
2018-03-05 18:49:07	BPL	Yhg1s: Ok, that hint of using __name__ has been quite useful to realize what's going on here. For instance, let's imagine case1) main.py: from a.b.c import global_var  foo.py: from c import global_var   and case2) main.py: from a.b.c import global_var foo.py: from a.b.c import global_var , in case1) global_var id is different because you've made 2 different imports while in case2) global_var is the same because you've made only 1
2018-03-05 18:49:07	BPL	import. Now, once I understand what's going on... is there any way to avoid this unpredictable behaviour?
2018-03-05 18:50:56	BPL	said otherwise, how to create a real singleton that I can share across moduless no matter how imported by clients?
2018-03-05 18:52:08	Yhg1s	BPL: never run something that lives inside a package directly; never mess with sys.path or PYTHONPATH.
2018-03-05 18:52:19	Yhg1s	BPL: only import modules once, under a single canonical name.

2018-03-05 18:59:45	⚡	You are now known as bbugyi201
2018-03-05 18:59:45	achillion	you can read the error string, yeah
2018-03-05 18:59:53	Hell-Razor	"returned non-zero exit status 3" for example
2018-03-05 19:00:31	Hell-Razor	achillion: I am digging and I dont see how, unless its another command.
2018-03-05 19:01:38	energizer	Hell-Razor: in that case, you can use subprocess.CalledProcessError
2018-03-05 19:01:40	achillion	Hell-Razor: "The CalledProcessError object will have the return code in the returncode attribute and output in the output attribute" (from check_output)
2018-03-05 19:02:15	achillion	so first you catch CalledProcessError, then check the returncode attrib for the codes you want to allow
2018-03-05 19:03:34	BPL	Yhg1s: Ok, don't mind my previous question, just found a quite nice solution which prevents me of bad using my module, ie: if __name__ != os.path.basename(os.path.splitext(__file__)[0]): raise Exception("...") , that way you'll guarante uniqueness of the global vars of that module, moving on.

2018-03-05 19:08:48	BPL	nedbat: first time hear that expression :) , is it the same than yikes??? Anyway, I'm all ears for better suggestions... I mean, if you make your package pip installable you can avoid havig this "trick", otherwise you can't assure the correct usage of your module "singletons"
2018-03-05 19:09:08	nedbat	BPL: you should make your package installable
2018-03-05 19:10:17	ali1234	energizer: i tried to implement wrap_gen in the code i'm working on and it blew up with "TypeError: 'StopIteration' object is not iterable"
2018-03-05 19:12:09	maum	Is there a way to read big data using pd.read_sql ?
2018-03-05 19:12:26	grym	maum: you can chunk/page results
2018-03-05 19:12:51	maum	grym: can you show me an example?
2018-03-05 19:14:09	maum	grym: for example, pd.read_sql(..., chunk = 100) ?
2018-03-05 19:14:30	grym	maum: i think it's `chunksize` instead of `chunk`
2018-03-05 19:15:09	grym	maum: and the value is an integer number of rows
2018-03-05 19:15:35	maum	grym: so... for chunk in pd.read_sql(...., chunksize=100): do_something_with_chunk ?
2018-03-05 19:16:12	grym	maum: that looks like the right idea to me.  chunk will be a dataframe
2018-03-05 19:16:24	raj	does py3 have to be installed after py2 on windows 10 for the environment variables not to be broken?

2018-03-05 19:25:08	raj	Additionally, in Windows should python not be installed in program fles due to permissions issues when pip installing things?
2018-03-05 19:25:31	ali1234	energizer: got it. it needs to return e.value to really behave like return (yield from x)
2018-03-05 19:30:19	Ninpo	Hell-Razor: did you refactor that curl code yet? :P
2018-03-05 19:30:29	Hell-Razor	Ninpo: Kind of
2018-03-05 19:30:45	Hell-Razor	Ninpo: I am trying here and trust me I appreciate everything you have tried to teach me

2018-03-05 19:32:28	Ninpo	so line 8-11 is your json

2018-03-05 19:33:11	Ninpo	Yes you do.  Programming is a crucible in which we strip away irrelevancies and ineffiencies until we're left with a pure, logical product.
2018-03-05 19:33:26	Hell-Razor	Ninpo: If yo uwant to help rewrite it, lets get it finished first and the results and trust me, I will re write this so its perfect
2018-03-05 19:33:30	Ninpo	I've been where you're at
2018-03-05 19:33:42	Ninpo	and this channel helped me greatly, I'm more than happy to pay it forward
2018-03-05 19:34:20	Hell-Razor	Just a fyi Ninpo we are getting hammered with snow right now. I need to head out in ~20 before the roads get too bad
2018-03-05 19:34:45	grym	maum: sure. that seems reasonable
2018-03-05 19:35:14	Hell-Razor	I am more concerned right now Ninpo if lines 29-31 are going to force an early closing of the text files
2018-03-05 19:35:35	maum	grym: the next loop will be started with 1001 row number?
2018-03-05 19:36:32	grym	maum: i should think so
2018-03-05 19:36:45	maum	grym: ah, ok thanks
2018-03-05 19:38:26	BPL	nedbat: Regarding the previous topic, let's say you make the package installable, and as a good practice i guess you're exposing the public interface to users in some nice __init__.py and document that, still... without using this trick python isn't guaranting users side-effect free for bad usage of your module. But with this centinel assertion (even if it's dirty code), unless some user modifies the source code you're preventing having
2018-03-05 19:38:26	BPL	duplicated "singletons"
2018-03-05 19:38:29	grym	maum: your external counter will be at 2000 though
2018-03-05 19:39:00	maum	grym: ok
2018-03-05 19:39:13	energizer	ali1234: right. check out the pep for yield from for the full thing
2018-03-05 19:39:16	grym	BPL: python is very, very good at letting me do whatever i want with your code.
2018-03-05 19:39:24	grym	BPL: and very bad at preventing it :)
2018-03-05 19:39:47	ali1234	energizer: so after i finally got it working i discovered the function doesn't yield anything anyway, it just returns a list :(
2018-03-05 19:40:04	energizer	ali1234: ouch
2018-03-05 19:40:07	ali1234	but hey i learned a lot anyway
2018-03-05 19:40:13	BPL	grym: That's actually quite true :) , yeah, usually you trust users in python world for many many things

2018-03-05 19:42:42	Ninpo	If you copy/pasta that as is it'll give you a syntax error
2018-03-05 19:42:49	Hell-Razor	Good timing, looks like we have about 4 inches already i nthe past 45 minutes. I need to head out
2018-03-05 19:42:59	Ninpo	:)
2018-03-05 19:43:05	Ninpo	Let me know how you get on, in PM if need be
2018-03-05 19:43:18	KirkMcDonald	FrostRobin1: Making this a class attribute, as opposed to an instance attribute, is strange to me.
2018-03-05 19:43:20	Ninpo	The fact you've kept at this is admirable :)
2018-03-05 19:44:05	Ninpo	I work with a lot of overpaid devs that would have done the os.system call, called it good enough and never revisited it again
2018-03-05 19:44:27	Hell-Razor	Ninpo: Well its either I get this working or I fail the class and waste ~$900
2018-03-05 19:45:06	ali1234	Ninpo: i missed the start of this but why using os? why not pathlib?
2018-03-05 19:45:12	DaPinkOne	why would you need to import twice though?
2018-03-05 19:45:20	Ninpo	Hell-Razor: well we can't have that.
2018-03-05 19:45:28	Ninpo	ali1234: no no, I'm helping Hell-Razor NOT do that
2018-03-05 19:45:30	FrostRobin1	KirkMcDonald, Which part?
2018-03-05 19:45:41	FrostRobin1	KirkMcDonald, laps?
2018-03-05 19:45:46	ali1234	Ninpo: but your paste contains os.listdir...
2018-03-05 19:45:48	BPL	nedbat: Quite easy, let's say your module has quite a nested tree and one of your multiple singletons is living deep in the hierarchy, dunno... mycoolmodule.utils.managers.whatever_manager, and whatever_manager has a singleton. Now, usually you'd expose whatever_manager to users in the __init__.py, right? But... what if some user decides to have a pth file in his virtualenv pointing to that utils directory. If for some reason he decides
2018-03-05 19:45:48	BPL	to import whatever_manager directly and also import your module the "right" way he'll get quite a lot of side-effects and he'll claim your module is buggy

2018-03-05 19:47:40	FrostRobin1	KirkMcDonald, I just figured I should put it at the end of my run_lap() method so that it only adds 1 to laps if it is called?
2018-03-05 19:47:56	FrostRobin1	KirkMcDonald, How should I change it to achieve the same result?
2018-03-05 19:48:24	BPL	nedbat: yeah, well... that's a good question :) , still... in any case, the moral of the story is, having duplicated singletons is not a pleasant thing, tell me about it, few minutes ago debugging almost for 20 minutes my singleton code when the "bug" was the way i was importing in across my modules... anyway
2018-03-05 19:48:41	KirkMcDonald	FrostRobin1: Is this homework?
2018-03-05 19:48:48	nedbat	BPL: i was debugging something just like this with a co-worker last week
2018-03-05 19:49:43	FrostRobin1	KirkMcDonald, No im learning on my own and its a challenge I found online.  Should I call my laps with self.laps at the end instead?
2018-03-05 19:50:29	Ninpo	I do love that python has become the goto for academia

2018-03-05 19:51:04	KirkMcDonald	FrostRobin1: You probably want to assign to it as self.laps inside of __init__, and also use self.laps later, yes.
2018-03-05 19:51:37	FrostRobin1	Ninpo, Python has so much versatility I wish I would have started earlier

I recall when i was a kid learning about graphical modes on asm was really fun, even if not that rewarding like what you can do with python nowadays. Still... just the fact of putting a single pixel on the
2018-03-05 19:58:11	BPL	screen was a big reward

2018-03-05 20:00:26	nedbat	BPL: i'm all in favor of people learning what fascinates them.  But not everyone wants low-level details

2018-03-05 20:00:59	is_null	if any
2018-03-05 20:01:52	BPL	nedbat: Sure thing, I mean, I guess it's a really good choice picking up python on schools for kids. At the end of the day, if one kid is curious he/she will learn the low-level stuff by its own
2018-03-05 20:02:53	teratorn	BPL: I don't think you can really influence whether or not someone will be drawn to low-level/systems-programming
2018-03-05 20:03:19	teratorn	not without being tyrranical, anyway
2018-03-05 20:04:22	BPL	teratorn: Yeah, that's a good point... and it's being proved than being tyranical with kids for learning new stuff has failed miserably zillion times, typical kids forced to learn an instrument for years playing music he/she doesn't like and after countless years abandoning playing music

2018-03-05 20:06:01	BPL	grym: yeah, exactly
2018-03-05 20:06:29	teratorn	FrostRobin1: as opposed to having a foundation in nothing? I would say yes
2018-03-05 20:06:31	grym	FrostRobin1: they're pretty seperate, but fluency in any language makes picking up the next one easier, to some extent
2018-03-05 20:06:54	grym	FrostRobin1: you have to contend with "how do I do X, which i know how to do, in this new langauge" instead of "what is X"
2018-03-05 20:07:03	grym	FrostRobin1: which is still a problem, but it's an easier one

2018-03-05 20:08:48	FrostRobin1	teratorn, I see how popular vr has become and where it is going and I am wanting to learn c#, then how to create games in unity. Then maybe after I am comfortable in those two things I can start creating apps and games in a virtual enviorment
2018-03-05 20:08:55	horribleProgram	I knew it
2018-03-05 20:09:04	teratorn	horribleProgram: ^
2018-03-05 20:09:07	horribleProgram	Unity only supports C#, that's the only reason why C# is used
2018-03-05 20:09:16	horribleProgram	well it supports UnityScript
2018-03-05 20:09:19	FrostRobin1	horribleProgram, I know, thats why i mentioned it
2018-03-05 20:09:22	grym	horribleProgram: that's not true, but unity support is very popular
2018-03-05 20:09:31	teratorn	horribleProgram: not entirely true... it supports other languages too. and I've even read reports about people using IronPython with it
2018-03-05 20:09:41	grym	teratorn: it's a godawful hack though
2018-03-05 20:09:51	grym	teratorn: c# really is the sane language to use with unity
2018-03-05 20:09:57	teratorn	no doubt
2018-03-05 20:10:07	grym	boo is deprecated now, i think totally
2018-03-05 20:10:10	horribleProgram	yeah
2018-03-05 20:10:19	FrostRobin1	teratorn, grym, have either of you worked much with agumented reality or virtual reality?
2018-03-05 20:10:26	teratorn	no
2018-03-05 20:10:27	grym	FrostRobin1: no, but i've used unity a whole lot
2018-03-05 20:10:31	horribleProgram	but I'm pissed I had to learn C# and still learning that language just because of Unity.
2018-03-05 20:10:41	grym	horribleProgram: why? it's a good langauge
2018-03-05 20:10:43	horribleProgram	and because there's no real good game engines that use Java or Python
2018-03-05 20:10:56	grym	neither of those are good choices for game engine langauges. :-P
2018-03-05 20:11:05	grym	java's braindead and python's comparitively slow
2018-03-05 20:11:12	horribleProgram	not for the language itself, but for the API
2018-03-05 20:11:27	horribleProgram	underlying language can be C++
2018-03-05 20:11:34	teratorn	don't say that
2018-03-05 20:11:37	teratorn	don't ever say that
2018-03-05 20:11:39	horribleProgram	just like Unity isn't written in UnityScript, but you can use it to make games
2018-03-05 20:11:43	FrostRobin1	grym, python isnt used for engines because it runs slow thanks to it being a highlevel language right?
2018-03-05 20:11:59	grym	FrostRobin1: there are a bunch of reasons, most of which don't matter in their specifics
2018-03-05 20:12:00	teratorn	horribleProgram: C++ is not something one mentions in polite company
2018-03-05 20:12:08	grym	teratorn: but muh abseil
2018-03-05 20:12:37	horribleProgram	dude, the point is that there's an underlying application, and can offer interfaces to that code with any language you choose, including and especially python
2018-03-05 20:13:01	grym	FrostRobin1: anyawy.  you will find that linq statements and python list comprehensions kind of feel similar, and new c# has a lot less verbose of syntax, so it can be more terse like python
2018-03-05 20:13:09	horribleProgram	Microsoft bought Unity so they made that language C#
2018-03-05 20:13:29	FrostRobin1	grym, thats good to know. So you think it is definitly worth learning the language?
2018-03-05 20:13:37	grym	horribleProgram: unity is not owned by microsoft
2018-03-05 20:13:39	teratorn	at the same time I'm both impressed and horrified that people keep making C++ "better"
2018-03-05 20:13:51	grym	FrostRobin1: i like c# the best of the "you must be object oriented or else" languages
2018-03-05 20:14:00	grym	(that i have used)
2018-03-05 20:14:15	horribleProgram	grym: ohh :P Why do I think that?
2018-03-05 20:14:22	horribleProgram	was there ever a discussion about Microsoft buying it?
2018-03-05 20:14:25	grym	horribleProgram: you might be thinking about xamarin ?
2018-03-05 20:14:47	horribleProgram	hmm possibly
2018-03-05 20:14:51	grym	horribleProgram: who used to be independent and are now microsoft-owned; they're kind of the mono maintainers
2018-03-05 20:14:54	grym	ish
2018-03-05 20:15:00	FrostRobin1	grym, haha fair enough, alright well when I finish my python course ill probably switch over.  Not abandoning python though it is to enjoyable to leave completely.
2018-03-05 20:15:19	grym	FrostRobin1: always good to have more than one tool in the toolbox
2018-03-05 20:15:30	grym	FrostRobin1: c# and python serve very different application needs, and i need both
2018-03-05 20:16:20	FrostRobin1	grym, as long as I have a hammer to knock myself out with ill be good. I have heard that python can be used inside of c# code is that true?
2018-03-05 20:16:40	BPL	I'd bet than engines like unreal or cryengine could perfectly have their editors/fronteds on python and still getting a proper performance like they do right now, if you want to constrain yourself for directx stuff c# isn't a bad choice though
2018-03-05 20:16:47	grym	FrostRobin1: you're probably thinking of ironpython, which i have no experience with at all but does provide .NET bindings (which is not the same as what you might think)
2018-03-05 20:16:49	horribleProgram	yes that's true
2018-03-05 20:17:09	horribleProgram	you can use python as a language, and it will be compiled to .NET bytecode
2018-03-05 20:17:26	grym	i can't think of anything that actually _does_ this, but i'm sure someone does
2018-03-05 20:17:33	horribleProgram	https://pythonnet.github.io/
2018-03-05 20:18:03	horribleProgram	no that's not the right URL
2018-03-05 20:18:11	horribleProgram	IronPython
2018-03-05 20:18:38	FrostRobin1	good to know.  Im just getting a feel for what c# has to offer.
2018-03-05 20:18:38	horribleProgram	BPL: EXACTLY
2018-03-05 20:18:44	teratorn	horribleProgram: yeah that's very different than what IronPython does
2018-03-05 20:18:51	horribleProgram	teratorn: yeah lmao :D
2018-03-05 20:19:21	horribleProgram	you know what's crazy? I was thinking about this for the past year or so
2018-03-05 20:19:44	horribleProgram	why can't you write some sort of xml document, or even a langauge-parser that does this for you, that will create any frontend
2018-03-05 20:20:27	FrostRobin1	Lol one other question what do you think about anaconda for python?
2018-03-05 20:20:45	horribleProgram	FrostRobin1: What about it?
2018-03-05 20:21:43	horribleProgram	Isn't it just a packaging scheme that comes with more Python libraries?
2018-03-05 20:22:08	horribleProgram	and some Jupyter IDE?
2018-03-05 20:22:16	grym	FrostRobin1: not a bad way to run python on windows, occasionally does strange things with bundled packages, but otherwise okay
2018-03-05 20:22:26	grym	FrostRobin1: there are better options in linux or mac
2018-03-05 20:22:48	FrostRobin1	grym, I run windows, but then again thanks to vmware I run all.  What are somebetter options for mac or linux?
2018-03-05 20:23:24	grym	FrostRobin1: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/  works great for installing on linux and mac; it's just a front-end to installing from source
2018-03-05 20:25:42	FrostRobin1	grym, So is it CLI based mostly?
2018-03-05 20:25:53	grym	FrostRobin1: completely, yes
2018-03-05 20:26:02	FrostRobin1	grym, that is nice.  Thanks for showing me
2018-03-05 20:26:42	horribleProgram	grym: oh btw, I made a game in both Unity and LibGDX
2018-03-05 20:27:01	horribleProgram	LibGDX is pretty good as well
2018-03-05 20:28:10	horribleProgram	grym: What platform are you targeting?
2018-03-05 20:29:16	FrostRobin1	How well does Unity work for IOS?
2018-03-05 20:30:17	nedbat	anyone know the right warnings.filterwarnings call to shut up this warning? https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/18fd89246333bfa1b76c1623df689214f3ce2bf3/Lib/collections/__init__.py#L49
2018-03-05 20:31:07	grym	horribleProgram: we target windows, mac, and android.  iOS "real soon now"
2018-03-05 20:31:21	grym	horribleProgram: this is a side-side-side project for all contributors, so the going is slow :)
2018-03-05 20:32:56	Cache_Money	I've queried a MySQL db using MySQLdb and it returned this string: 'How to Make Cr\xe8me Br\xfbl\xe9e'. I'm now trying to insert it into a PostgreSQL db using psycopg2 but I'm getting this error: DataError: invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0xe8 0x6d 0x65. Any idea how to handle these sorts of things in Python 2?
2018-03-05 20:33:00	horribleProgram	grym: cool :)
2018-03-05 20:34:26	teratorn	Cache_Money: its unclear if you're working with byte-strings or unicode-strings, and it would be helpful to see actual code
2018-03-05 20:35:21	Cache_Money	teratorn: how do I tell whether a string a byte-string or unicode-string?
2018-03-05 20:35:43	teratorn	Cache_Money: in python2 it's either str or unicode, the former being a byte-string
2018-03-05 20:36:24	Cache_Money	teratorn: The string returned from the MySQL db was a `str`
2018-03-05 20:36:57	teratorn	Cache_Money: OK, so you have some random blob of raw bytes. now you've asked Postgres to interpret those bytes as UTF8 data, I guess, and it isn't
2018-03-05 20:37:32	⚡	Jigsy` is now known as Jigsy
2018-03-05 20:37:35	teratorn	Cache_Money: maybe if you convert it to unicode first before giving it to Postgres...
2018-03-05 20:37:35	horribleProgram	Cache_Money: you gotta pass in the encoded version of the string, which is s.encode('utf-8')
2018-03-05 20:37:40	horribleProgram	yeah
2018-03-05 20:38:18	horribleProgram	because the internal storage of that string might not be unicode, and for whatever reason the method you're calling doesn't convert it itself
2018-03-05 20:38:21	teratorn	horribleProgram: not exactly what I said, but yeah
2018-03-05 20:38:44	teratorn	presumably s.encode('utf-8') will fail...
2018-03-05 20:39:03	teratorn	so you may need to pass some options to encode() to force it to work, or otherwise sanitize the data
2018-03-05 20:39:28	Cache_Money	teratorn: You're correct, it failed with this message: UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe8 in position 14: ordinal not in range(128)
2018-03-05 20:41:09	horribleProgram	worked for me
2018-03-05 20:41:24	nedbat	Cache_Money: can you pastebin the code?
2018-03-05 20:41:34	teratorn	Cache_Money: I'm not sure what that means or in what context you get that error, we're missing a lot here
2018-03-05 20:42:02	horribleProgram	s.encode('utf-8') -> b'How to make Cr\xc3\xa8me Br\xc3\xbb1\xc3\xa9e'
2018-03-05 20:43:08	nedbat	horribleProgram: you are using python 3, Cache_Money is on python 2.
2018-03-05 20:43:12	horribleProgram	ohhhhh
2018-03-05 20:45:26	Cache_Money	nedbat: This is the line where the code is breaking: `cur.execute("INSERT INTO urls (url, title) VALUES (%s, %s);", (page_url, page_title))`
2018-03-05 20:45:41	maum	Is there a way to check if the link is pdf file or not?
2018-03-05 20:46:00	horribleProgram	is it because python2 str's don't support non-ascii text, and the 'utf-8' argument is ignored and it tries to encode as ascii
2018-03-05 20:46:05	nedbat	Cache_Money: can you at least pastebin the full error report?
2018-03-05 20:46:36	enginco	Hey all, question for you. I'm running a python program with multiple threads, each of which needs to keep track of 4 variables. Each thread will have these variables, but the values should be thread specific. These values also need to be passed into multiple functions and updated, sometimes two at a time. Would it be smart to use threading.local() here?
2018-03-05 20:46:38	Cache_Money	Okay, give me a sec
2018-03-05 20:46:40	nedbat	horribleProgram: python 2 str's are byte strings. if you call .encode on it, Python says, "Oh, you need a Unicode string to encode, i'll just go ahead and decode your bytestring to make unicode first"
2018-03-05 20:46:42	maum	Is there a way to check if the link is pdf file or notConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(104, 'Connection reset by peer'))?
2018-03-05 20:47:05	nedbat	enginco: why not just use 4 locals in each thread?
2018-03-05 20:47:08	horribleProgram	nedbat: ohhh
2018-03-05 20:47:16	enginco	Currently I'm declaring them in the thread start function, and updating them based on the return values of the functions, but sometimes I need to update multiple values
2018-03-05 20:47:16	maum	I tested this code: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/zoWk2IuLlrAjgkoKgIeM/
2018-03-05 20:47:29	maum	but the error like above
2018-03-05 20:47:32	▷	CrtxReavr just created a dict of dicts of dicts.
2018-03-05 20:47:35	enginco	nedbat: I can, but for instance, one of the function needs to update 3 of the values
2018-03-05 20:47:42	Cache_Money	nedbat: Here's the output from my iPython terminal when trying to run my code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/bfe20cdb0bc26d1b7d7603dfac7df6d4
2018-03-05 20:47:43	nedbat	enginco: ok, so return three values.
2018-03-05 20:47:48	CrtxReavr	Ugly, but effective.
2018-03-05 20:48:03	CrtxReavr	Cache_Money, have you tried it outside of ipython?
2018-03-05 20:48:09	enginco	nedbat: fair enough, that's what I'm currently doing. Is there a reason NOT to use threading.local()?
2018-03-05 20:48:18	enginco	The same reason not to use globals?
2018-03-05 20:48:21	nedbat	enginco: it's just more complicated than you need.
2018-03-05 20:48:28	enginco	nedbat: fair enough
2018-03-05 20:48:34	enginco	nedbat: thank you
2018-03-05 20:48:55	nedbat	enginco: you find you have a bunch of values that many functions want to change, maybe you want a class?
2018-03-05 20:49:04	Cache_Money	CrtxReavr: Here it is outside of iPython https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3edcc2b3976be024f10739b3e53bcc81
2018-03-05 20:49:25	enginco	nedbat: that's actually really smart, then each thread can have a thread specific instance of that class
2018-03-05 20:49:30	nedbat	Cache_Money: you have a byte string that your db is interpreting as utf8, but it's not utf8
2018-03-05 20:50:45	Cache_Money	nedbat: Okay. So, is there any way to convert it to utf8?
2018-03-05 20:51:25	djapo	can functools.partials be used with async functions?
2018-03-05 20:51:36	enginco	nedbat: This may be a silly question, but if in the start function of the thread I declare obj = MyClass(), and then pass it into a function which calls obj.updateSomeVal(), those changes should persist after the function? Basically, is it pass by reference when it comes to objects?
2018-03-05 20:51:53	nedbat	enginco: yes
2018-03-05 20:52:49	horribleProgram	Cache_Money: can you plz try this? https://pastebin.com/HJZEErjU
2018-03-05 20:52:49	infobob	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/N6zgDdiNiKZ8jqTsZzGb/ (repasted for horribleProgram)
2018-03-05 20:53:13	enginco	nedbat: wonderful, thanks!
2018-03-05 20:53:22	Cache_Money	horribleProgram: Okay, give me a sec
2018-03-05 20:54:04	nedbat	horribleProgram: you can't wrap .encode() around the arguments: it isn't a string.
2018-03-05 20:55:10	horribleProgram	"INSERT INTO urls (url, title, author, publish_date, publish_time, post_type, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s);", (query_result[0], query_result[1], query_result[2], query_result[3], query_result[3], query_result[4], datetime.now(), datetime.now()) is a string
2018-03-05 20:55:11	Cache_Money	horribleProgram: I got this error: NameError: name 'codecs' is not defined. So, I `import codecs` and then got this error: TypeError: encode() argument 2 must be string, not tuple
2018-03-05 20:55:37	horribleProgram	OHH I know
2018-03-05 20:55:55	horribleProgram	cur.execute() takes a string and a tuple?
2018-03-05 20:55:57	horribleProgram	two arguments?
2018-03-05 20:56:08	horribleProgram	I thought that entire expression was a string formatting expression
2018-03-05 20:56:30	nedbat	Cache_Money: change query_result[0]   to    query_result[0].decode('iso8859-1')
2018-03-05 20:56:32	Cache_Money	Yeah, the first string is the query (with `%s`) which is populated with the items in the tuple
2018-03-05 20:56:46	nedbat	Cache_Money: and again and again.
2018-03-05 20:57:07	neoncontrails	Is it redundant to prefix a pattern arg to re.match with ^?
2018-03-05 20:57:48	horribleProgram	yeah that's it
2018-03-05 20:59:00	nedbat	neoncontrails: it is redundant.
2018-03-05 20:59:06	newdimension	As a variable name, does opt mean optional by convention?
2018-03-05 20:59:09	Cache_Money	nedbat: That worked. Can you explain what happened there?
2018-03-05 20:59:13	nedbat	neoncontrails: some people choose to only ever use re.search, and use ^
2018-03-05 20:59:40	nedbat	Cache_Money: your bytes string was most likely iso8859-1 encoded.  decoding it produced a unicode string, which your db layer was willing to use.
2018-03-05 21:00:05	Cache_Money	nedbat: gotcha. Thanks for the input!
2018-03-05 21:00:25	neoncontrails	nedbat: heh, peculiar. What does re.match do with flag arguments like multiline, are they simply ignored?
2018-03-05 21:01:09	CrtxReavr	What variable can I add to a class so that type() can recognize it?
2018-03-05 21:01:14	nedbat	neoncontrails: multiline is still useful with match.
2018-03-05 21:01:40	nedbat	CrtxReavr: can you elaborate?
2018-03-05 21:02:35	CrtxReavr	I want ``type(MyClass)`` to return MySpecialObjectName
2018-03-05 21:03:01	nedbat	CrtxReavr: what's wrong with    class MySpecialObjectname:    ?
2018-03-05 21:03:11	horribleProgram	that would return class type
2018-03-05 21:04:21	CrtxReavr	yeah, what horribleProgram said.
2018-03-05 21:04:43	nedbat	CrtxReavr: i see.  can you say more about why you want that?
2018-03-05 21:04:56	CrtxReavr	Besides. . . it'll be referenced by instances of the class.
2018-03-05 21:06:45	CrtxReavr	Big program, lots of classes & instances.. .  just wnat a way to recognize their type.
2018-03-05 21:07:12	nedbat	CrtxReavr: isinstance(my_obj, SomeType)   # what's wrong with this?
2018-03-05 21:08:30	CrtxReavr	But where will SomeType come from?
2018-03-05 21:08:57	nedbat	CrtxReavr: i don't know what you are trying to do.  Python lets you check the types of things.  Why do you need your class to do something different than usual>
2018-03-05 21:08:57	nedbat	?
2018-03-05 21:09:18	nedbat	CrtxReavr: tell us more about "a way to recognize their type".  Be specific. what do you need to do?
2018-03-05 21:15:59	snacks	hello.
2018-03-05 21:16:41	snacks	Will python 2.7 code break with a python 3 interpreter?  Is there a guide to convert a codebase to python 3 ?
2018-03-05 21:17:00	nedbat	snacks: python 2 code in general will not run in python 3

2018-03-05 21:38:24	newdimension	nedbat: Does that create a symlink to the local project in the environment? I remember reading something long those lines, but I don't see anymore in the docs
2018-03-05 21:38:43	nedbat	newdimension: something like that.
2018-03-05 21:38:55	newdimension	nedbat: thanks for the help. I'll try it out
2018-03-05 21:39:36	PrinceOsiria	Hi there! I gave sort of a huge request, so apologies in advance. I know nothing about python at all, but for an ARG I'm hoping to get an old code debugged so that we can brute force rather than work manually, does anyone have a minute to help me out?

2018-03-05 21:43:55	PrinceOsiria	We have a list of keys we think could be in it, but the code here was orig built to brute force every possible configuration with multiple layers, but this is a super early version of the code, and the final bit has dissapeared
2018-03-05 21:44:00	PrinceOsiria	final version*
2018-03-05 21:45:43	PrinceOsiria	I believe the problem with it is something todo with the decrypting and encrypting itself, but I cant be sue

2018-03-05 22:30:20	soLucien	hi guys ! Have you ever ran into the issue with PyCharm that the Run .. action works perfectly, but when you Debug, it cannot find the module name ?
2018-03-05 22:30:35	soLucien	i've been struggling with this for the last hour , no idea how to fix it
2018-03-05 22:31:14	grym	soLucien: no, but sometimes IDEs get confused.  Does this problem persist in a terminal?
2018-03-05 22:33:39	soLucien	grym running works fine in the terminal
2018-03-05 22:33:44	soLucien	how do i test the debug action ?
2018-03-05 22:34:53	grym	soLucien: normally a restart of pycharm fixes things, but i'm not above nuking $PROJECT_ROOT/.idea if i have to
2018-03-05 22:35:21	soLucien	i did that once already
2018-03-05 22:35:38	soLucien	i just did
2018-03-05 22:35:57	soLucien	import pdb
2018-03-05 22:35:57	soLucien	;pdb.set_trace() and ran from the terimnal -- it worked as expected
2018-03-05 22:36:44	grym	and project interpreter, etc are set up properly?
2018-03-05 22:39:38	soLucien	yes
2018-03-05 22:39:47	soLucien	so i opened the parent folder instead
2018-03-05 22:39:51	soLucien	and it seems to work
2018-03-05 22:40:11	xqb	moot
2018-03-05 22:40:17	xqb	toot toot
2018-03-05 22:40:29	xqb	it also sounds like it works?
2018-03-05 22:40:35	soLucien	i'm not going to investigate further ..
2018-03-05 22:41:01	soLucien	yes,works now
2018-03-05 22:41:26	soLucien	for reasons unknown to me . The gods have been merciful

2018-03-05 22:42:05	sartan	soLucien: sounds like you have a difference between project interpreter project files (mark as source root) and runtime configuration for PYTHONPATH
2018-03-05 22:42:11	offby1	hm, "brew" now treats python3 as the default

2018-03-05 22:42:34	soLucien	yes i believe pythonpath was not set upon debug
2018-03-05 22:42:40	puff	Good evening.
2018-03-05 22:43:16	grym	soLucien: pythonpath is best ignored totally, in my experiences
2018-03-05 22:43:25	sartan	soLucien: the 'mark as source root' option can also automatically append to pythonpath... and this way you don't have to try to override this on individual run/debug configurations
2018-03-05 22:43:32	grym	offby1: that's kinda cool!
2018-03-05 22:43:54	soLucien	sartan i had done that
2018-03-05 22:45:11	sartan	well, that cosmic bit that flipped your ecc register just returned back to normal. it's working the way you want it to now?
2018-03-05 22:45:11	tcpdump	Hey everyone. I have a CentOS 7 box. I have install python36 and symlinked /usr/bin/python3 to python36.  Ive noticed that python34-pip has an install, but there is not 36.  Theres a python36u-pip...
2018-03-05 22:45:14	tcpdump	What is the u?
2018-03-05 22:46:00	offby1	beats me
2018-03-05 22:46:05	soLucien	sartan no, i opened the parent folder which means i have some extra c++, matlab and documentation which i should not see
2018-03-05 22:46:32	soLucien	but i will try to ignore it when i ctrl-shift-f for now
2018-03-05 22:46:55	sartan	tcpdump: looks like identifier in IUS binary you installed that wasn't part of EPEL or upstream centos?
2018-03-05 22:47:32	sartan	it's named and set up in a way to not conflict with stock distribution package names
2018-03-05 22:47:50	sartan	https://ius.io/SafeRepo/#parallel-installable-package here's the project philosophy that will help explain why it's named differently, and libraries in a different path
2018-03-05 22:48:04	sartan	It must not conflict, obsolete, or interfere with any upstream python package (eg, python3.4).
2018-03-05 22:48:07	tcpdump	sartan: not sure... Everything Ive done has been a clean install using yum.
2018-03-05 22:48:08	sartan	hence the extra letter
2018-03-05 22:48:17	grym	soLucien: you can mark directories as ignored
2018-03-05 22:48:23	tcpdump	also, thanks for the link.
2018-03-05 22:48:27	sartan	tcpdump: where did you install python 3.6 from?
2018-03-05 22:49:23	sartan	this is certainly an ius package
2018-03-05 22:50:18	sartan	soLucien: ah, there's an outstanding pycharm bug that actually incorrectly uses 'ginored file types and folders' string and fails to include those in pythonpath, even if you explicitly set it
2018-03-05 22:50:39	sartan	if the folder is ignored, it may also be removed from pythonpath
2018-03-05 22:50:47	tcpdump	sartan: whats a ius?  Can it be used just the same?
2018-03-05 22:51:14	matsaman	it mentinos RHEL, so I'm assuming it's nonsense
2018-03-05 22:51:14	sartan	tcpdump: review your documentation for how you installed python 3.6 - because this doesn't comef rom upstream apt repositorieis. you installed a third party package, and this is the way this third party package is named
2018-03-05 22:51:26	matsaman	mentions, that is
2018-03-05 22:53:59	sartan	@ soLucien it seems you could be hitting something similar to this issue https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-5459
2018-03-05 22:54:23	sartan	Within that comment thread there are anumber of fixes to help... one of the ones i use is appending sys.path manually when i do interactive terminals
2018-03-05 22:55:30	soLucien	thanks sartan! I'll take a look
2018-03-05 22:56:10	sartan	soLucien: also takea look at linked issues for this ticket as well
2018-03-05 22:56:29	sartan	I've spent a long time wrangling pycharm's paths to my advantage..  I still don't have it toally figured out.
2018-03-05 22:57:58	xqb	wish i was pythonpath :<

2018-03-05 23:04:35	matsaman	is homebrew like the only package manager that has a pyenv package?
2018-03-05 23:04:36	grym	snacks: first i install pyenv, and then i use pyenv to install 3.6.x
2018-03-05 23:04:37	snacks	grym: installing pythong 2.7.14 via pyenv didn't install pip

2018-03-05 23:05:17	matsaman	...gross
2018-03-05 23:05:34	altendky	matsaman: you prefer things to be out of date?
2018-03-05 23:05:54	grym	matsaman: i mean.  the whole point of pyenv is that "it's only bash"
2018-03-05 23:06:06	grym	so it's at least self-aware about its grossness
2018-03-05 23:06:08	xqb	ya
2018-03-05 23:06:25	snacks	grym: I already have pyenv installed.  Installing python 2.7 with it says command not found when trying to look for pip.

2018-03-05 23:07:23	altendky	snacks: did you do the shims stuff?
2018-03-05 23:07:53	matsaman	if it's a bash script you should be able to just place it someplace without having to "install" it
2018-03-05 23:07:55	altendky	snacks: also, make sure you know what pip you are running first
2018-03-05 23:08:42	grym	snacks: https://paste.pound-python.org/show/MHPiYWZRCwOVFFuyNTbw/  worked for me

2018-03-05 23:10:06	altendky	matsaman: well, the shims and the installed pythons wouldn't make much sense in a bash script. Is there something you prefer over pyenv?
2018-03-05 23:10:42	snacks	grym: pyenv shell worked for me too.  But local didn't.
2018-03-05 23:10:43	grym	matsaman: i mean, "installation" means "clone to $HOME/.pyenv and insert myself into .bashrc"

2018-03-05 23:12:16	snacks	my dir for local's cat .python-version says --> 2.7.14
2018-03-05 23:12:48	grym	snacks: remove it; open a totally new terminal window, and try again
2018-03-05 23:12:56	snacks	ok
2018-03-05 23:13:06	grym	(graping at straws a little, but bash is dumb sometimes)
2018-03-05 23:13:17	matsaman	altendky: I haven't quite found a need to test against so many python versions myself
2018-03-05 23:13:18	offby1	grape soda through a straw
2018-03-05 23:14:08	altendky	matsaman: what about just having latest?  And I've needed several versions for running tests when contributing to projects that nicely support several.
2018-03-05 23:14:52	grym	i mostly use pyenv to strictly divorce whatever i do from whatever the system python is
2018-03-05 23:15:02	matsaman	altendky: just latest my distro usually manages <shrug>
2018-03-05 23:15:04	altendky	Or 3.7 and 3.8 dev for a patch to python3 itself
2018-03-05 23:15:51	grym	and if everything goes pear-shaped, i can wipe pyenv-managed versions of python with much less stress than brew or apt
2018-03-05 23:16:57	snacks	grym: nope.  still didn't work http://codepad.org/b8xneEh7
2018-03-05 23:17:16	grym	snacks: what's your .bashrc
2018-03-05 23:17:20	grym	assuming you use bash
2018-03-05 23:17:51	grym	snacks: because pyenv is like, half-working
2018-03-05 23:18:20	altendky	grym: a new terminal window wouldn't reload bashrc, would it? Doesn't that require a full logout?
2018-03-05 23:18:29	grym	snacks: `which python` should return `$HOME/.pyenv/shims/python`
2018-03-05 23:18:32	grym	altendky: depends on the OS
2018-03-05 23:18:42	grym	altendky: sourcing issues usually go away for me if i do that, though
2018-03-05 23:18:44	snacks	grym: ah ha!! That's it.  Forgot to source .bash_profile
2018-03-05 23:18:50	snacks	thanks a bunch!!
2018-03-05 23:18:50	matsaman	shouldn't, a full logout & back in is just quite a simple way
2018-03-05 23:18:53	grym	ahhhh great
2018-03-05 23:18:56	grym	excllent.
2018-03-05 23:19:44	grym	matsaman: these modern linuxes and their disabling of ctrl alt backspace
2018-03-05 23:19:51	matsaman	grym: I KNOW!
2018-03-05 23:19:58	grym	philistines
2018-03-05 23:20:01	matsaman	I have mine re-re-re-enabled
2018-03-05 23:20:04	matsaman	it makes me crazy
2018-03-05 23:20:23	matsaman	being able to destroy your frontend is honestly one of the best things about X-land over macOS, Windows, etc.
2018-03-05 23:20:31	grym	how else am i going to reset my nvidia drivers after wine+WoW screws them up?
2018-03-05 23:20:35	grym	oh, wait, it's not 2007
2018-03-05 23:20:49	offby1	gaah, I still twitch when I think of ctrl-alt-backspace
2018-03-05 23:20:53	grym	now i need to reset my nvidia drivers after cuda screws them up..
2018-03-05 23:20:55	offby1	I hit that by accident so many times
2018-03-05 23:21:09	matsaman	offby1: trying to hit what?
2018-03-05 23:21:24	offby1	well, ctrl-alt-backspace :-)  It means something in emacs
2018-03-05 23:21:25	grym	i command-Q "QUIT IMMEDIATELY" firefox about 5 times a week
2018-03-05 23:21:31	matsaman	offby1: ha, emacs =P
2018-03-05 23:21:40	matsaman	grym: yeah I used to use that extension to disable that, heh =P
2018-03-05 23:32:34	puff	Good evening.
2018-03-05 23:33:08	puff	I'm looking at this example code: https://github.com/WildApricot/ApiSamples/tree/master/python
2018-03-05 23:33:54	puff	Trying to figure out what's going on here.  In theory it's documented at https://gethelp.wildapricot.com/en/articles/484
2018-03-05 23:34:42	puff	At the moment I'm looking at ApiObject's __init__() method.  I *think* what it's trying to do is something clever, to wit parsing the JSON and creating a tree of objects, instance variables, etc.

2018-03-06 00:26:23	lasds	dropbox is written in python. Why is it when I launch dropbox, I don't see any python script? dropbox looks like a desktop app. Not a script.
2018-03-06 00:27:00	jfhbrook	I mean
2018-03-06 00:27:15	jfhbrook	is dropbox written in python? if so which part?
2018-03-06 00:27:17	energizer	lasds: it has a gui https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface
2018-03-06 00:27:28	KirkMcDonald	I imagine it's the server side that's in Python.
2018-03-06 00:27:42	jfhbrook	I'd imagine a lot of backend code is in python, that's plausible, but I would expect the desktop app to be a non python desktop app (though I could be wrong here)
2018-03-06 00:27:49	energizer	doesnt guido work at dropbox?
2018-03-06 00:28:36	lasds	https://www.codeinstitute.net/blog/7-popular-software-programs-written-in-python/
2018-03-06 00:28:38	energizer	brandon rhodes too
2018-03-06 00:29:13	lasds	can a python script be packaged into a Windows 10 installer and be installed like an app?
2018-03-06 00:29:21	energizer	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2678180/how-does-dropbox-use-python-on-windows-and-os-x
2018-03-06 00:30:39	energizer	http://www.openwall.com/presentations/WOOT13-Security-Analysis-of-Dropbox/
2018-03-06 00:31:28	_habnabit	lasds, sure
2018-03-06 00:31:53	_habnabit	lasds, how would it 'look like a script'?
2018-03-06 00:32:33	lasds	if dropbox client written in python, the code will be exposed. it's a script. how does dropbox protect its code?
2018-03-06 00:32:45	_habnabit	lasds, why would you need to protect it?
2018-03-06 00:33:25	lasds	so that competitors won't duplicate the product
2018-03-06 00:33:30	energizer	too late
2018-03-06 00:33:40	jfhbrook	dropbox doesn't protect their code
2018-03-06 00:33:47	_habnabit	lasds, dropbox's storage isn't in the client ;)
2018-03-06 00:34:11	jfhbrook	this is all very interesting if still current, I feel like dropbox can afford to do a native app so this is surprising
2018-03-06 00:34:30	lasds	so, for desktop clients written in python, code cannot be protected. Correct?
2018-03-06 00:34:36	jfhbrook	these answers are all from 2010
2018-03-06 00:34:46	jfhbrook	I mean define protected
2018-03-06 00:34:49	energizer	lasds: it can be more or less annoying to reverse
2018-03-06 00:34:50	_habnabit	lasds, that's true for any languge
2018-03-06 00:34:53	jfhbrook	you can reverse engineer compiled code, people do it all the time
2018-03-06 00:35:13	lasds	i guess the secret lies in the backend code which cannot be exposed
2018-03-06 00:35:19	jfhbrook	that's one strategy
2018-03-06 00:35:33	_habnabit	lasds, that is the only way it's possible to protect code, yes
2018-03-06 00:35:37	jfhbrook	another one is copyright enforcement + workable licensing
2018-03-06 00:35:43	_habnabit	lasds, but.. i'm not really sure what part of dropbox you think is or needs to be 'secret'
2018-03-06 00:35:45	energizer	what is "the secret" tho
2018-03-06 00:35:51	lasds	frontend code written in python or js can always be reverse engineered. If wanna protect, write in C++. Is this right?
2018-03-06 00:35:58	jfhbrook	no
2018-03-06 00:36:14	jfhbrook	you can reverse engineer c and c++, and beyond that it's just not clear what you're protecting
2018-03-06 00:36:15	energizer	i think the conventional wisdom is "dont bother, nobody cares"
2018-03-06 00:36:27	_habnabit	lasds, do you think windows is written in python or js, if it regularly gets cracked? ;)
2018-03-06 00:36:32	lasds	jfhbrook: C++ is not a scripting language. Code is not exposed
2018-03-06 00:36:47	_habnabit	lasds, what's a scripting language
2018-03-06 00:36:53	jfhbrook	but there are explicitly tools that will take compiled machine code and turn it into almost readable c
2018-03-06 00:37:07	lasds	_habnabit: scripts are not compiled into binaries. So, code is for all to see
2018-03-06 00:37:34	jfhbrook	you compile things not because it obfuscates your methods but because it's faster (and possibly proven to be some level of correct)
2018-03-06 00:37:55	_habnabit	lasds, have you looked inside a .pyc file? ;)
2018-03-06 00:39:15	energizer	tho actually i remember reading long ago that the dropbox folks came up with some really innovative ways to get their indicator icons to work on macos
2018-03-06 00:39:44	lol-md5	i can use for x in collection: yield x or yield from collection in a regular generator. in python 3.6, i can for x in collection: yield x. how come i can't yield from collection inside of an async function in python3.6?
2018-03-06 00:40:15	jfhbrook	do async functions let you yield at all?
2018-03-06 00:40:20	energizer	lol-md5: you have to await
2018-03-06 00:40:35	lol-md5	jfhbrook yes they do, in 3.6+
2018-03-06 00:40:37	lol-md5	async generator
2018-03-06 00:40:45	_habnabit	lol-md5, async functions are a pretty thin hack on top of iterators, and the semantics of mixed await/yield are confusing
2018-03-06 00:40:55	lol-md5	rip
2018-03-06 00:40:57	lol-md5	it could be a thing tho
2018-03-06 00:41:00	energizer	lol-md5: the point is that those are two separate kinds of operations , so they want to prevent you from mixing them
2018-03-06 00:41:01	lol-md5	it should be a thing tho
2018-03-06 00:41:02	jfhbrook	I'm legitimately surprised that async generators are a thing
2018-03-06 00:41:11	jfhbrook	on the face of it it seems like a bad idea
2018-03-06 00:41:28	lol-md5	why jfhbrook ? you can already make async iterators, why not make it easier?
2018-03-06 00:41:46	jfhbrook	what do you mean by async iterator
2018-03-06 00:41:50	lol-md5	energizer preventing you from mixing them is less important than consistency
2018-03-06 00:42:04	jfhbrook	it's not about mixing them, it's the fact that one of them /is/ the other
2018-03-06 00:42:06	lol-md5	something that you can `async for row in connection.cursor(query, *args)` for instance
2018-03-06 00:42:19	lol-md5	yeah but inside an already async function the meaning is different
2018-03-06 00:42:30	lol-md5	the meaning in an async func is basically `for x in collection: yield x`
2018-03-06 00:42:43	jfhbrook	the meaning of *what* in an async func
2018-03-06 00:42:55	energizer	no thats like the implementation, not th emeaning
2018-03-06 00:42:56	lol-md5	the meaning of `yield from` in an async func
2018-03-06 00:44:41	jfhbrook	what I'm saying is that there's no semantic difference between a coroutine, and a generator of Futures + other generators
2018-03-06 00:45:11	deniska	jfhbrook: except there is a semantic difference between a generator and async generator :)
2018-03-06 00:45:44	deniska	jfhbrook: one has __iter__, another has __aiter_
2018-03-06 00:46:08	deniska	and then __next__ vs __anext__
2018-03-06 00:46:14	jfhbrook	and __aiter__ presumably returns a Future ?
2018-03-06 00:46:25	deniska	jfhbrook: __aiter__ returns an awaitable
2018-03-06 00:46:40	runciter	(something with an __await__)
2018-03-06 00:46:49	jfhbrook	which presumably itself returns a Future
2018-03-06 00:46:55	deniska	jfhbrook: Future is a concept from asyncio, awaitable is a part of python data model
2018-03-06 00:46:59	deniska	jfhbrook: Future is awaitable
2018-03-06 00:47:09	_habnabit	deniska, you're thinking of it the wrong way around. the difficult part is that the implementation lent itself to one or the other, but mixing the two together muddies the semantics and makes things complicated
2018-03-06 00:47:17	jfhbrook	so how o you get a value out the other side?
2018-03-06 00:47:36	jfhbrook	like there has to be some kinda half-assed monad returned somewhere, right?
2018-03-06 00:49:02	deniska	_habnabit: from the end user perspective it's quite simple: async generator is something you can put in async-for
2018-03-06 00:49:15	_habnabit	deniska, and i'm not talking about the end user perspective
2018-03-06 00:49:54	runciter	at some point you'll have to step through the `async for`
2018-03-06 00:50:02	runciter	even if you're an end user
2018-03-06 00:50:03	kira0204	If I have an object, can I find out the path of the class object belongs to
2018-03-06 00:50:04	kira0204	??
2018-03-06 00:51:04	deniska	runciter: well, sure, it's more or less equivalent to a for loop, except you put `a` in front of dunder methods and the exception is now called AsyncStopIteration or something like that
2018-03-06 00:51:26	runciter	right but it'll take you through __anext__
2018-03-06 00:51:33	papna	kira0204: There is no way to reliably -- there might not even be one!
2018-03-06 00:51:38	papna	kira0204: __qualname__ might be a decent guess
2018-03-06 00:51:43	papna	kira0204: Why do you ask?
2018-03-06 00:51:53	deniska	runciter: just like a normal loop takes you through __next__
2018-03-06 00:53:25	kira0204	papna: so there is file, let's call it abc.py in which I have written a class, now I am importing this abc.py to a new python file xyz.py in which I am using the class to create an object. Now I have this  object and I want to know the path of abc.py
2018-03-06 00:53:55	_habnabit	kira0204, you just said it: abc.py
2018-03-06 00:54:08	papna	kira0204: "Now I have this  object and I want to know the path of abc.py" Why do you want to know? And why don't you already know?
2018-03-06 00:54:46	runciter	deniska: yeah, but now you also have to worry about sys.get_asyncgen_hooks
2018-03-06 00:55:40	jfhbrook	this feature seems heinously complicated
2018-03-06 00:55:58	runciter	jfhbrook: it's a lot
2018-03-06 00:56:05	kira0204	_habnabit , papna : the problem is bigger and it will take me another two hours to actually explain the problem :P , the point here is that although I know what that the file is abc.py, but how do I print the path of it. So basically I want to use print(something) in xyz.py which will print me /path/to/abc.py
2018-03-06 00:56:12	energizer	runciter: what is this thing?
2018-03-06 00:56:14	jfhbrook	and so does __await__, I looked up how it's spec'd in the pip and there's no way the description is complete
2018-03-06 00:56:18	runciter	energizer: async generators
2018-03-06 00:56:23	jfhbrook	pep*
2018-03-06 00:56:28	papna	kira0204: This is for a human reading some text output?
2018-03-06 00:56:33	jfhbrook	you can guess which one I type more often
2018-03-06 00:56:56	runciter	jfhbrook: you have to read the `yield` and `yield from` PEPs
2018-03-06 00:57:11	papna	kira0204: Rather than spending two hours, you could also just post the code :)
2018-03-06 00:57:38	energizer	runciter: what's the intention behind sys.get_asyncgen_hooks?
2018-03-06 00:57:38	runciter	async/await is a relatively small extension to those
2018-03-06 00:58:11	jfhbrook	you add a callback to the future that chucks the result back into the generator, no?

2018-03-06 00:58:43	jfhbrook	cripes it's way past midnight
2018-03-06 00:58:44	jfhbrook	i gotta go
2018-03-06 00:59:15	deniska	jfhbrook: it's important not to confuse async/await syntax with asyncio library, asyncio is merely one of the users of that part of a datamodel\
2018-03-06 00:59:19	kira0204	papna: I am contributing to an open source organisation, so the original issue was https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2787 and my PR with the solution was https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pull/2928
2018-03-06 01:00:31	runciter	energizer: when regular generators are deallocated, python calls their close() method which throws GeneratorExit inside of them and iterates over them to ensure finally blocks/context managers' __exit__s run
2018-03-06 01:00:42	kira0204	papna: no as you will see, I want to improve the error message by also including the path of the file which throws an error
2018-03-06 01:01:05	kira0204	papna: *now
2018-03-06 01:01:06	runciter	energizer: but an async generator must have an async close method in case of an await in the finally block or an async context manager's __aexit__
2018-03-06 01:01:38	kira0204	energizer: How are youo? :) good to see you
2018-03-06 01:01:56	runciter	energizer: that aclose method must be called by the event loop, so that whatever is blocking the generator can be resumed
2018-03-06 01:02:12	papna	kira0204: You can use __qualname__ or inspect.getfile to get the qualified path or to get the file it was defined in
2018-03-06 01:02:14	energizer	hey kira0204
2018-03-06 01:02:18	runciter	so they stash a finalizer into a thread-local list
2018-03-06 01:02:25	papna	kira0204: Keep in mind not all classes have such a thing.
2018-03-06 01:03:06	kira0204	papna: thanks :) I will look into it
2018-03-06 01:06:32	energizer	runciter: i'm not quite there yet, but how come it can't just attach the hooks to the async gen instead of involving sys?
2018-03-06 01:14:11	wilornel	Hey #python! I am looking to work with async and await
2018-03-06 01:14:56	wilornel	It seems to me like it's not possible to call an async function, sleep while the async function does its work, then get the result from the future
2018-03-06 01:15:28	wilornel	if my async function is:

2018-03-06 01:15:51	_habnabit	wilornel, one doesn't really 'get results' from a future except by awaiting it
2018-03-06 01:15:57	wilornel	and I do `future = slow(); sleep(5); result = yield future`, there will be a sleep during the `yield future`
2018-03-06 01:16:15	energizer	wilornel: what's gen?
2018-03-06 01:16:21	wilornel	tornado's gen
2018-03-06 01:16:33	_habnabit	does tornado allow await?
2018-03-06 01:16:38	mrsolodolo	hello! i just installed kevy. i am running it on windows7 64bit.And i am having this error "ImportError: No module named app"
2018-03-06 01:16:40	wilornel	I was trying to use tornado before I realized there is async and await
2018-03-06 01:16:58	mrsolodolo	does anyone know anything about this?
2018-03-06 01:16:58	wilornel	I am not sure. should I just change `await gen.slee(seconds)` with `sleep(seconds)`?
2018-03-06 01:17:33	wilornel	I am trying to see for myself if I can have an async function do work while my main function is sleeping
2018-03-06 01:17:43	wilornel	I am reading through the following right now: https://snarky.ca/how-the-heck-does-async-await-work-in-python-3-5/
2018-03-06 01:19:16	energizer	that is a good article
2018-03-06 01:19:20	wilornel	this example http://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#getting-started does not seem much different from using a simple yield instead of await
2018-03-06 01:19:54	_habnabit	wilornel, i suggest http://krondo.com/an-introduction-to-asynchronous-programming-and-twisted/ btw
2018-03-06 01:20:13	_habnabit	wilornel, why is it you think that 'await' and 'yield' are the same?
2018-03-06 01:20:28	wilornel	they look similar for the example I linked from curio.readthedocs.io
2018-03-06 01:20:47	_habnabit	wilornel, you mean.. they're both five-letter words that are statements?
2018-03-06 01:21:22	wilornel	one second, I'm trying to wrap my head around too many things at once
2018-03-06 01:24:57	wilornel	here: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/4xRRM3sHn9/
2018-03-06 01:25:01	wilornel	_habnabit: that's how I see the example here: http://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#getting-started
2018-03-06 01:25:58	_habnabit	wilornel, this code can't have more than one countdown running concurrently, because your 'sleep' blocks
2018-03-06 01:27:02	wilornel	alright, that's what I'm trying to figure out with the examples I'm doing in my jupyter notebook
2018-03-06 01:27:17	wilornel	should async and await work in jupyter notebooks, by the way? I know Jupyter uses tornado under the hood
2018-03-06 01:28:01	wilornel	if I spin up an async countdown from main, I should still be able to run functions inside main and the countdown code should run asynchronously, right?
2018-03-06 01:28:41	wilornel	let me design a simple example
2018-03-06 01:29:54	_habnabit	wilornel, async/await might, if jupyter has hooks for doing the awaits
2018-03-06 01:30:12	_habnabit	wilornel, it has to cooperate with your code. you can't force jupyter to await something
2018-03-06 01:32:09	deniska	well, you can run loop.run_until_complete, but it will just essentially be a blocking operation
2018-03-06 01:33:30	_habnabit	deniska, only in asyncio (we're talking about tornado), and run_until_complete is a terrible antipattern
2018-03-06 01:34:01	wilornel	my example: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/f4xgRYhw5p/ , _habnabit ,  deniska, energizer
2018-03-06 01:34:13	wilornel	I expect line 16 not to wait for 1 second
2018-03-06 01:34:49	_habnabit	wilornel, you're mixing blocking and nonblocking here
2018-03-06 01:35:07	wilornel	line 13 is nonblocking
2018-03-06 01:35:12	wilornel	and line 16 is blocking, as per the outputs, right?
2018-03-06 01:35:34	_habnabit	wilornel, lines 6, 14, and 23 are blocking
2018-03-06 01:35:57	wilornel	alright
2018-03-06 01:36:16	wilornel	they are blocking the GIL?
2018-03-06 01:36:25	wilornel	is it possible for an async function to not block the GIL?
2018-03-06 01:36:38	runciter	they're unrelated
2018-03-06 01:36:51	_habnabit	wilornel, forget about the GIL
2018-03-06 01:37:00	wilornel	alright
2018-03-06 01:37:30	_habnabit	wilornel, the GIL is an optimization that sows confusion
2018-03-06 01:37:31	wilornel	I'm still unclear on how this works. I expect to not have to wait on line 16
2018-03-06 01:37:55	runciter	why?
2018-03-06 01:38:02	_habnabit	wilornel, 'await' doesn't magically make something blocking into something nonblocking
2018-03-06 01:38:40	wilornel	I thought that by doing `rr = slow() ; sleep(2)` , I gave `slow` some time to run (it needs 1 second, I gave it 2 seconds), before I retrieved its result
2018-03-06 01:38:46	_habnabit	wilornel, no
2018-03-06 01:39:59	wilornel	Why not? How could I make them nonblocking?
2018-03-06 01:40:22	_habnabit	wilornel, calling an async function does nothing until it's awaited
2018-03-06 01:40:38	_habnabit	wilornel, they're not separate threads of execution
2018-03-06 01:42:09	wilornel	is it possible to make them separate threads? I don't see the point of this if I still have to wait
2018-03-06 01:42:11	wilornel	to me, this looks just like using yield right now
2018-03-06 01:42:23	wilornel	res = slow(); sleep(2); next(res)
2018-03-06 01:42:40	_habnabit	wilornel, nope. a generator does nothing until you call next() on it
2018-03-06 01:42:51	wilornel	exactly
2018-03-06 01:42:52	wilornel	what is happening here
2018-03-06 01:43:10	_habnabit	wilornel, where is here? it's the same thing in both cases
2018-03-06 01:43:10	wilornel	nothing is happening with our async until we `await` it
2018-03-06 01:43:37	wilornel	in the paste.ubuntu.com example, the async does nothing until I do `await` on it
2018-03-06 01:44:00	wilornel	in the paste.ubuntu.com example, the coroutine does nothing until I do `await` on it
2018-03-06 01:44:26	wilornel	you can see that by how, on line 16, it still has to wait 1 second
2018-03-06 01:45:05	_habnabit	wilornel, i'm not sure what you're asking, then, by 'what is happening'
2018-03-06 01:45:06	deniska	_habnabit: run_until_complete is quite useful for "do an async thing in the otherwise synchronous program"
2018-03-06 01:45:17	re1	has anyone done storing images on s3 before (lots of them) and then linking to them in postgres database? any advices/tuts on this?
2018-03-06 01:45:31	_habnabit	deniska, not really! because it prevents any chance of cleanup or teardown whatsoever
2018-03-06 01:46:17	wilornel	"is it possible to make them separate threads? I don't see the point of this if I still have to wait"
2018-03-06 01:46:20	wilornel	"to me, this looks just like using yield right now"
2018-03-06 01:46:32	deniska	_habnabit: loop.run_until_complete(do_async_teardown_things()) :P
2018-03-06 01:46:34	wilornel	but you say that no, a generator is different, because a generator does nothing until you call next() on it
2018-03-06 01:46:48	_habnabit	deniska, yes, except it's impossible to know what things those are
2018-03-06 01:46:56	wilornel	but I tell you that the coroutine in my example is the same, it does nothing until I use `await` on it
2018-03-06 01:47:03	_habnabit	wilornel, oh, no, they're not different
2018-03-06 01:47:10	_habnabit	wilornel, exactly the same
2018-03-06 01:47:17	wilornel	what?....
2018-03-06 01:47:24	wilornel	this is discouraging
2018-03-06 01:47:47	_habnabit	wilornel, why? this isn't meant to be like threaded code
2018-03-06 01:48:18	wilornel	this looks just like threaded code
2018-03-06 01:48:26	wilornel	it is simply threaded. There's nothing concurrent here
2018-03-06 01:48:29	_habnabit	wilornel, threaded code doesn't have 'await'
2018-03-06 01:48:41	wilornel	but this await is a simple yield
2018-03-06 01:48:51	_habnabit	wilornel, yes, because you're not awaiting anything async
2018-03-06 01:49:01	wilornel	I'm awaiting an async function
2018-03-06 01:49:13	_habnabit	wilornel, you're awaiting an async function that's actually just a blocking function
2018-03-06 01:49:19	_habnabit	wilornel, it just doesn't block until you await it
2018-03-06 01:50:13	wilornel	Can I have it run before I await on it so that I can get the result right away when I await it?
2018-03-06 01:50:26	wilornel	can I await asynchronously?
2018-03-06 01:50:35	_habnabit	wilornel, no, that's not what async functions do. and yes, await is always asynchronous
2018-03-06 01:50:46	_habnabit	wilornel, but, 'asynchronous' doesn't mean 'make blocking things nonblocking'
2018-03-06 01:51:07	wilornel	await on line 16 is clearly synchronous https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/f4xgRYhw5p/ because it blocks
2018-03-06 01:51:46	_habnabit	wilornel, if you had awaited something that suspends execution instead of blocking, it would've been asynchronous
2018-03-06 01:52:08	wilornel	what is something that can suspend execution instead of blocking?
2018-03-06 01:52:16	_habnabit	wilornel, like i said, this isn't a system for magically making a blocking function appear nonblocking
2018-03-06 01:52:33	_habnabit	wilornel, well, that's specific to your event loop. asyncio has asyncio.sleep
2018-03-06 01:53:25	wilornel	https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/pKTg26wvrP/
2018-03-06 01:53:48	wilornel	This has the same behavior, it stills takes a second to go over line 16
2018-03-06 01:54:01	_habnabit	wilornel, why did you expect this to be different?
2018-03-06 01:54:17	wilornel	"wilornel, if you had awaited something that suspends execution instead of blocking, it would've been asynchronous"
2018-03-06 01:54:27	wilornel	and you said that asyncio.sleep suspends execution
2018-03-06 01:54:46	wilornel	so I used asyncio.sleep to try that and it seems like it does not become asynchronous in that case
2018-03-06 01:54:48	_habnabit	wilornel, yes, and it does. so line 16 is asynchronously waiting for one second
2018-03-06 01:55:31	wilornel	asynchornously blocking?
2018-03-06 01:55:37	_habnabit	wilornel, no, not blocking. waiting
2018-03-06 01:55:41	wilornel	asynchronously synchronously blocking?
2018-03-06 01:56:14	wilornel	alright, so when something waits, the runtime is brought back to the event loop
2018-03-06 01:56:29	_habnabit	wilornel, yes
2018-03-06 01:56:35	wilornel	and none of the functions in the task running
2018-03-06 01:56:39	_habnabit	wilornel, yes
2018-03-06 01:57:08	_habnabit	wilornel, it means if you had called slow() three times and awaited all of them, they'll complete in 1 second instead of 3
2018-03-06 01:57:21	_habnabit	wilornel, awaited all of them in parallel, that is
2018-03-06 01:58:27	wilornel	yeah I just awaited them serially and it took 3 seconds
2018-03-06 02:04:52	wilornel	if I use `loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.gather(`, is it possible to get their results or should I have them put their result in a variable that they can all access?
2018-03-06 02:05:34	_habnabit	wilornel, well, first, never use run_until_complete. but gather returns a thing you await with the all the results from the things you passed it
2018-03-06 02:06:19	wilornel	what should I use if not `run_until_complete`?
2018-03-06 02:06:45	_habnabit	wilornel, are we talking about asyncio in general or your tornado code?
2018-03-06 02:07:21	wilornel	I don't want to use tornado if I can achieve what I'd like to do with asyncio
2018-03-06 02:07:35	wilornel	tornado has more stuff related to web servers and http requests that I do not need
2018-03-06 02:08:05	_habnabit	wilornel, python has lots of things you don't need too :)  but are you still talking about cooperating with jupyter?
2018-03-06 02:08:17	wilornel	so let's talk about asyncio. why should I never use `run_until_complete`?
2018-03-06 02:08:38	_habnabit	wilornel, from earlier: it prevents any chance of cleanup or teardown whatsoever
2018-03-06 02:08:43	wilornel	I don't necessarily need to work with Jupyter. I use jupyter as a repl to try things out a lot. I might need to cooperate with it for some things but that is not mandatory
2018-03-06 02:09:14	wilornel	what should be used instead?
2018-03-06 02:09:26	wilornel	I read that but was not sure what to make of it
2018-03-06 02:10:01	_habnabit	wilornel, run_forever
2018-03-06 02:12:23	wilornel	with `asyncio.ensure_future`, could I start a coroutine and come back to it later to get its result, from within a task?
2018-03-06 02:13:00	_habnabit	wilornel, you can't get a result without awaiting the coroutine or future, so i'm not entirely sure what you're asking
2018-03-06 02:16:50	wilornel	darn, I want it to be possible for the runtime to come back to the task that is calling a coroutine somehow....
2018-03-06 02:17:15	_habnabit	wilornel, can you explain that in a different way? i'm not really sure what you're talking about
2018-03-06 02:17:27	wilornel	that's how I see futures
2018-03-06 02:17:45	wilornel	alright, I'm off to bed
2018-03-06 02:17:52	wilornel	maybe tomorrow I'll ask again
2018-03-06 02:17:55	_habnabit	ok
2018-03-06 02:18:46	wilornel	good night, thank you _habnabit
2018-03-06 02:20:25	_habnabit	np
2018-03-06 02:23:02	gulzar	hi. I need to generate a timestamp. I used             timeStamp = time.strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M", time.localtime())  .But it gives UTC and not localtime or adjusted UTC (+5.30) How to get this working?.
2018-03-06 02:23:21	gulzar	why is it striked out?
2018-03-06 02:30:00	deniska	gulzar: there's a weird character between `%M` and `",` in your message
2018-03-06 02:31:04	deniska	gulzar: doesn't datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M") produce what you want?
2018-03-06 02:31:14	v01d4lph4	gulzar: You can just add the offset to UTC time?
2018-03-06 02:32:39	v01d4lph4	deniska: datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M") this also gives UTC.
2018-03-06 02:33:08	deniska	v01d4lph4: well, that means that the local time of your system is utc
2018-03-06 02:36:09	gulzar	v01d4lph4: yes multiple methods. I need to get the current location time . I am only getting UTC
2018-03-06 02:36:31	gulzar	Local time: Tue 2018-03-06 13:06:12 IST    Universal time: Tue 2018-03-06 07:36:12 UTC
2018-03-06 02:36:49	gulzar	I am getting 7.36 . I need 13.06
2018-03-06 02:37:51	_habnabit	gulzar, use the arrow module to adjust to whatever timezone you want shown
2018-03-06 02:43:33	v01d4lph4	gulzar: use datetime.utcoffset?
2018-03-06 02:44:00	v01d4lph4	or as _habnabit is saying, try arrow module, though it can be done using core library also.
2018-03-06 02:44:16	_habnabit	i wouldn't bother using datetime or time. arrow is much better
2018-03-06 02:44:18	gulzar	v01d4lph4: I am trying to avoid external libs as much as possble
2018-03-06 02:44:22	_habnabit	gulzar, why?
2018-03-06 02:44:39	v01d4lph4	_habnabit: Haha, to each his own.
2018-03-06 02:44:47	gulzar	_habnabit: this is needed for a website. More external libs, more chances of breakdown after updates
2018-03-06 02:44:51	_habnabit	v01d4lph4, 'his'? ;)
2018-03-06 02:45:30	_habnabit	gulzar, i don't follow. what does being a website matter? you don't have to update third-party libraries at every version released
2018-03-06 02:48:40	_habnabit	gulzar, anyway, avoiding third party libraries tends to be very annoying for no real reason
2018-03-06 02:49:26	gulzar	_habnabit: yes, can't avoid all. But as much as possible. I am even avoiding some js libs which makes things easier

2018-03-06 02:49:52	gulzar	if not possible wiht core libs , wil then use arrow
2018-03-06 02:49:56	_habnabit	gulzar, i honestly don't understand what you mean. if you already have at least one third-party dependency, what does reducing the number help?
2018-03-06 02:50:53	gulzar	_habnabit: yes, I am not gonna be here forever and people here don't understand linux or python much .Easier I make things, better it is for future. I have lots of external libs but only when no other option
2018-03-06 02:51:46	_habnabit	gulzar, now i'm really confused. if you don't use a library, you have to rewrite part of the library yourself. why is it easier to understand code that you wrote vs. code in a library?
2018-03-06 02:52:30	deniska	gulzar: once you have a process for handling dependencies in place (at the very least, the requirements.txt file), 1 library vs 10 doesn't make a huge difference
2018-03-06 02:52:32	gulzar	I will use exertnal libs IF core libs are not sufficeint
2018-03-06 02:53:15	gulzar	deniska: thats is better idea.
2018-03-06 02:54:20	_habnabit	gulzar, well, the stdlib is really bad (especially in the case of date/time handling) but conceptually a third-party library is just some python code that you didn't write. obviously you can rewrite the library code yourself by hand, but.. why would you want to?
2018-03-06 02:54:35	gulzar	_habnabit: agree
2018-03-06 02:54:51	_habnabit	gulzar, then why are you avoiding third-party libraries? :)
2018-03-06 02:57:24	gulzar	let's see how arrow works

2018-03-06 03:54:44	py_dev	Is there some public Flask-implemented code I could learn from?
2018-03-06 03:54:45	py_dev	Please recommend something I could read on Github.
2018-03-06 03:55:34	liste	py_dev: microservice is just a Web service that does 1 thing
2018-03-06 03:55:46	_habnabit	py_dev, 'microservice' is a buzzword for 'an http server that has a small API'
2018-03-06 03:56:00	liste	py_dev: here's one I made recently https://github.com/metatavu/wns-pusher

2018-03-06 03:58:10	deniska	you connect via a socket and it spews out json objects at you ._.
2018-03-06 03:58:21	py_dev	liste, _habnabit: In other words, in my current app which already does wallet deductions and crediting, does this mean all the new 'microservice' would do is take API calls to do the wallet operations?
2018-03-06 03:58:57	liste	py_dev: yes
2018-03-06 03:59:00	deniska	py_dev: microservice is more or less taking things which would be module boundaries and making them into process boundaries
2018-03-06 03:59:16	liste	py_dev: and if there's multiple things the app would do it'd use multiple microservices
2018-03-06 03:59:59	kosh	deniska, sounds like another name for unix ;)
2018-03-06 04:00:22	kosh	deniska, multiple processes that each do a single small thing and chaining them together
2018-03-06 04:00:55	_habnabit	i've gotta say this does not sound like a good use case for smaller API service area
2018-03-06 04:00:59	liste	except microservices are not programs, but services, possibly controlled and hosted by somebody else
2018-03-06 04:01:27	py_dev	_habnabit: What is 'this'?
2018-03-06 04:01:28	kosh	liste, there is very little difference
2018-03-06 04:02:14	py_dev	liste: I'm confused when you say they are not 'program' but 'services'.
2018-03-06 04:02:27	py_dev	s/programprograms
2018-03-06 04:02:31	kosh	although microservices are FAR more fragile since it is more likely for a remote service to fail than a call to a local executable
2018-03-06 04:02:32	py_dev	s/program/programs
2018-03-06 04:02:53	py_dev	kosh: My thoughts exactly!
2018-03-06 04:03:10	kosh	py_dev, web people think they have invented something fundamentally new when they make a program work over http
2018-03-06 04:03:11	py_dev	Because it requires network calls.
2018-03-06 04:03:31	kosh	py_dev, since that is completely different than any of the previous ways the same program could work over a network
2018-03-06 04:04:07	liste	py_dev: I mean some party offers the microservice just as a HTTP API - you can't always run it yourself, you can't scale it yourself, it probably has a monthly or per-transaction fee etc...
2018-03-06 04:04:20	deniska	kosh: with tons of sed and awk in between. Or in case of microservices, more microservices transforming JSON into JSON :)
2018-03-06 04:04:38	liste	py_dev: but on the other hand you don't need to take care of such things yourself, all you need is to access them via their API
2018-03-06 04:05:38	▷	deniska likes when things work in a single process on a single machine :)
2018-03-06 04:06:24	liste	microservices have a ton of overhead and complexity, like the requirement to have distributed transactions or lower-level atomicity/concurrency management
2018-03-06 04:06:30	py_dev	liste: But it could also mean longer response times.
2018-03-06 04:06:33	liste	and handling of network failures etc
2018-03-06 04:06:36	liste	py_dev: yes
2018-03-06 04:07:00	liste	network latency is in a whole different ballpark than just a method call
2018-03-06 04:08:34	py_dev	Regardless. I feel the need to build a microservice for our (my company's) wallet management, since we now have different products that use wallets, and I'm trying to avoid building a wallet into each one.
2018-03-06 04:09:03	liste	py_dev: did you consider just making a wallet library?
2018-03-06 04:10:05	py_dev	liste: No. I did not think about that, but I think microservice approach would make it easy to use a single database for the wallet.
2018-03-06 04:11:16	liste	you can have a single database even if you implement it as a library, and that would simplify transaction management

2018-03-06 11:36:06	siege	1.53503 hours is indeed 1 hour, 32 minutes, 6 seconds and change so there doesn't appear to be a mismatch
2018-03-06 11:36:10	papna	1:32 is a little over an hour and a half

2018-03-06 11:42:27	csed	Does anyone see any obvious problem with wrapping a file handle in a class and having it have a function that closes and opens up the file? Basically I'm trying to handle log rotation, if anyone has a better idea on how to go about it.
2018-03-06 11:42:53	weedom	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/4NUvw5FzfchpfQKBhYWT/ - got it. For anyone that's interested, line.strip() was the answer.
2018-03-06 11:43:26	weedom	logrotated, csed
2018-03-06 11:43:39	weedom	why rewrite that? It's been working for years
2018-03-06 11:44:43	tech2	csed: also, why not log via syslog etc. which handles that for you?
2018-03-06 11:44:58	foo	uh, note to self: if requests.get() returns a 404 - eg. response is 404, then if response: evaluates to False. How does an object change it's return status like that? I didn't even know that was possible. I can see the use, but I didn't know that
2018-03-06 11:45:18	csed	weedom: No no. So I'm trying to handle a log parser in Python, that opens up a log that's handled via logrotate. So logrotate does its thing and my script isn't handling it properly.
2018-03-06 11:45:24	csed	tech2 ^
2018-03-06 11:45:25	tech2	foo: the instance's __bool__ method (or one of a few others)
2018-03-06 11:45:52	tech2	csed: if you have the file open already you don't magically lose access to it.
2018-03-06 11:45:55	foo	tech2: awesome, so that's a thing. I'll have to refactor this, then. Thank you!
2018-03-06 11:46:03	weedom	csed: you could have a look at tail, then, and in particular the nuance between -f and -F
2018-03-06 11:46:37	weedom	-f follows the file, but if the inode moves then it stops working. -F for tail follows any inode moves
2018-03-06 11:47:08	weedom	My life changed forever when I learned that!
2018-03-06 11:47:27	Wooble	weedom: presumably they want to open the new file, not keep the old one open.
2018-03-06 11:47:41	csed	tech2: No, but since I'm doing a log parser that runs 24/7, file gets rotated and suddenly tell()/seek() are all borked. So what I did was I implemented a SIGUSR1 that closes and reopens the handle, but that's not working properly.
2018-03-06 11:48:14	csed	weedom: You mean running tail -F via subprocess?
2018-03-06 11:48:37	pk64_work	Pici: tech2 , I suppose I am not understanding why the time delta is 1:32, and the division 1.53
2018-03-06 11:48:47	pk64_work	I am just looking to convert the seconds to a HH:MM:SS format
2018-03-06 11:49:00	pk64_work	but I want to account for any small to large seconds
2018-03-06 11:49:12	Wooble	weedom: err, nevermind, tail -F just retries opening the file anyway, which does sound like what they wanted.
2018-03-06 11:49:13	siege	pk64_work, division is decimal, time is not
2018-03-06 11:49:15	weedom	that's what the -F does, Wooble. If logrotated (or anything, really) moves the pointer to the file, -F tracks the change.
2018-03-06 11:49:20	pk64_work	ah... ok I see 1.53 division wise vs human readable
2018-03-06 11:49:24	weedom	*snap*
2018-03-06 11:49:27	pk64_work	ok sorry
2018-03-06 11:49:52	weedom	csed: yeah, I think that's probably what you want.
2018-03-06 11:49:52	Wooble	weedom: I thought you meant if the inode of the open file got a new location, it keeps the file open. :)
2018-03-06 11:50:00	foo	tech2: I guess if I want to know if an object exists, eg. response is a 404 or 200 (and is *something), I want: if response is not None - correct?
2018-03-06 11:50:01	csed	tail -F (not -f) works fine, I've tested it. Problem is I need to do a whole lot of parsing on the lines. But I haven't really considered running a tail -F via subprocess.
2018-03-06 11:50:28	Wooble	csed: I'd recommend looking at what tail does and do that in python code, instead of using a subprocess.
2018-03-06 11:50:45	csed	Wooble: That's sort of what I did, literally.
2018-03-06 11:51:04	tech2	foo: response.raise_on_error()
2018-03-06 11:51:17	tech2	foo: or something like that
2018-03-06 11:52:09	csed	Wooble: But reopening the file just doesn't work, right. SIGUSR1 gets handled properly, mind you.
2018-03-06 11:52:18	merpnderp	Can someone tell me why Pandas isn't writing the csv as it read it here?
2018-03-06 11:52:20	foo	tech2: Probably mean: .raise_for_status()

2018-03-06 11:52:21	merpnderp	https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/YyNyHBF3/
2018-03-06 11:52:31	csed	Another thing I can do is have DEBUG spout out tell() on log rotation, see where that gets me.
2018-03-06 11:53:28	weedom	I'm from perl world, mainly, and us perly folks would just run the subprocess... csed & Wooble
2018-03-06 11:56:19	Wooble	weedom: I rarely called subprocesses when I was a perl programmer. But then I was mostly writing stuff on windows that had to also work on linux.

2018-03-06 19:00:26	nedbat	Budgii: if you ask a question, people will help
2018-03-06 19:00:43	xstasi	nedbat: are we allowed to paste code into the channel tho?
2018-03-06 19:00:52	runciter	you can use a pastebin
2018-03-06 19:01:04	nedbat	xstasi: why are you using a different name? You've been here long enough to know how things work.
2018-03-06 19:01:24	xstasi	ya
2018-03-06 19:01:27	xstasi	thats why im asking
2018-03-06 19:01:34	xstasi	cuz i can see clueless persons pasting into the channel
2018-03-06 19:01:38	xstasi	and no ones around
2018-03-06 19:01:48	xstasi	sounds like the ops arent doing their best job
2018-03-06 19:01:53	nedbat	xstasi: you're making a lot of noise to no effect.
2018-03-06 19:02:07	cluelessperson	Okay!  I get a numpy array,  (60,80,1)  containing 16 bit values   and I'm trying to convert it to an image
2018-03-06 19:02:11	nedbat	xstasi: and being rude to people.  stop it.
2018-03-06 19:02:28	jake9879	Hey! Quick question. Say I have a string, str = "b'hello'", how do I treat it as a byte literal, meaning, how do I look at it as if I typed str_bytes = b'hello'. ?
2018-03-06 19:02:30	cluelessperson	I'm doing, a = numpy.reshape(a, (60,80)),   OR   a = numpy.squeeze(a, axis=2)
2018-03-06 19:02:35	cluelessperson	and I get this resulting image
2018-03-06 19:03:01	cluelessperson	https://i.imgur.com/wl5WVcc.png
2018-03-06 19:03:09	Budgii	xstasi, it's not something I wrote, it's something i'm reading for class and trying to decide if it's non-comprehensive or just me.
2018-03-06 19:03:13	ayee	echo $STASH_USER gives me "ayee", but when I do >>> os.environ.get('STASH_USER', '') I get ''
2018-03-06 19:03:21	ayee	Does python not inherit my bash env variables?
2018-03-06 19:03:24	cluelessperson	I think maybe I need to reshape the array somehow
2018-03-06 19:03:35	Budgii	nedbat: +1, I know people are helpful here. thanks :)
2018-03-06 19:03:44	ayee	I'm starting the python terminal in the same directory where I'm doing the echo commands
2018-03-06 19:04:30	nedbat	ayee: it should get them. Did you export STASH_USER?
2018-03-06 19:05:03	nedbat	jake9879: where did the string come from? That sounds unusual
2018-03-06 19:06:15	ali1234	nedbat: https://github.com/ali1234/ugly/
2018-03-06 19:06:19	jake9879	netbat: It is an unusual case, I'm getting it through a serial connection, where the other device is running python, but sending the data as a string.
2018-03-06 19:06:44	ayee	nedbat: weird, works now. must be pebkac. maybe I didn't export the first time
2018-03-06 19:06:51	ali1234	nedbat: start with ugly/drivers/base.py and then look at how terminal.py uses multiple inheritance to combine the base classes
2018-03-06 19:07:04	nedbat	jake9879: can you change the other side of the connection? Have it send the string properly?
2018-03-06 19:07:09	KirkMcDonald	jake9879: It's sending the repr of a bytes object?
2018-03-06 19:08:01	jake9879	:KirkMcDonald Exactly.
2018-03-06 19:08:38	jake9879	KirkMcDonald: Exactly.
2018-03-06 19:09:10	jake9879	netbat: I can change the other side of the connection, but I want to able to send any data, even if it might not be presentable as a string.
2018-03-06 19:09:25	nedbat	jake9879: what other kinds of data?
2018-03-06 19:09:39	nedbat	ali1234: i see what you are doing here.  it doesn't change my opinions though :)
2018-03-06 19:09:47	jake9879	netbat: Say, a binary file.
2018-03-06 19:10:39	TwistedBlizzard	Hi all, I'm writing a simple calculator as part of my university course using tkinter as the gui. I'm trying to get the window resizes to change the size of the text in the buttons but running this and resizing the window causes the window to go black and the cpu to hit 100%. https://paste.pound-python.org/show/OTyJ4sL2hs7c46UFCDB1/
2018-03-06 19:10:47	nedbat	ali1234: at the very least can I get you to change __name to _name ?
2018-03-06 19:11:08	ali1234	nedbat: you really hate that stuff... i guess i can do that
2018-03-06 19:11:10	nedbat	jake9879: you mean a bytestring. you can't send a file, but you can send its contents.  What else?
2018-03-06 19:11:16	nedbat	ali1234: there's just no point.
2018-03-06 19:11:33	ali1234	nedbat: i am more concerned about the inheritance design than whether stuff is visible from outside or not
2018-03-06 19:12:16	nedbat	ali1234: i think we have different approaches
2018-03-06 19:12:47	jake9879	netbat: Yes, I wanna send bytes.
2018-03-06 19:13:31	nedbat	jake9879: so far the types on the table are bytes, and bytes.  Anything else?
2018-03-06 19:14:09	nedbat	jake9879: (btw, you can type n e d <tab> and it will complete my nick)
2018-03-06 19:14:55	jake9879	netbat: Just thought of a kinda hack for a solution. If I have str = "b'hello'". I can run: exec("b={}".format(str)). And get b as the desired bytes type
2018-03-06 19:15:12	nedbat	jake9879: you are right: that is a hack
2018-03-06 19:16:02	jake9879	nedbat: Yeah. I want to send bytes. Not anything else.
2018-03-06 19:16:36	nedbat	jake9879: ok, then why not just send the bytes as bytes?  no need for b'' etc
2018-03-06 19:20:41	jake9879	nedbat: All I can do is read the interpreter output. Meaning, what is sent is the interpreter  output. So on the other side if b is a bytes variable all I can do is print(b) and read the output.
2018-03-06 19:21:07	KirkMcDonald	jake9879: sys.stdout.buffer.write(b)
2018-03-06 19:22:22	TwistedBlizzard	Update - this only happens when rezizing the window fast. It's exacerbated if resizing both of the dimensions together. I switched to windows and it doesn't turn the window back, it flickers the font sizes instead.
2018-03-06 19:23:31	dimino	hey so I've got exception code but when I try to print the error I get "None"
2018-03-06 19:23:34	dimino	it's in a catch
2018-03-06 19:23:56	dimino	it's in an async context manager
2018-03-06 19:24:00	nedbat	dimino: if you pastebin the latest code and full error report, we can help
2018-03-06 19:24:04	dimino	it's basically around the "yield"
2018-03-06 19:24:08	dimino	oh sure, I can do the snipped
2018-03-06 19:24:39	dimino	thought the problem is a lack of error heh
2018-03-06 19:28:50	dimino	nedbat: this? https://paste.pound-python.org/show/39sNNDFpT1uqPP7ttUIh/
2018-03-06 19:29:41	nedbat	dimino: i don't understand how that can be
2018-03-06 19:29:50	dimino	AGREED
2018-03-06 19:29:58	dimino	maybe __repr__ returns None?
2018-03-06 19:30:08	dimino	or w/e
2018-03-06 19:30:19	nedbat	dimino: that will get you the __str__, which should be the exception message.
2018-03-06 19:30:27	dimino	sorry yes that
2018-03-06 19:30:29	nedbat	dimino: change it to {e.__class__} to see
2018-03-06 19:31:08	nedbat	or i guess {type(e)} or {e!r}
2018-03-06 19:31:15	fresheyeball	hello out there
2018-03-06 19:31:27	dimino	Exception in timer context manager: <class 'aiohttp.client_exceptions.ServerDisconnectedError'>
2018-03-06 19:31:33	dimino	okay can work with that
2018-03-06 19:31:48	ali1234	nedbat: got d/c sorry. i think i saw everything you said. so you may dislike my approach, but i'm not asking you to work on this code base :) ... are there any objective problems with it that you think i'll hit later (other than the __names, which i'll probably change)
2018-03-06 19:32:01	fresheyeball	I have never used python before
2018-03-06 19:32:07	nedbat	fresheyeball: welcome :)
2018-03-06 19:32:18	fresheyeball	but would like to use it to prototype some ML stuff for my own edification
2018-03-06 19:32:24	fresheyeball	nedbat: Hiya!
2018-03-06 19:32:26	nedbat	ali1234: objective problems? probably not.
2018-03-06 19:32:52	fresheyeball	I am looking to find the ropes and fast, so please excuse my extremely easy questions
2018-03-06 19:33:16	fresheyeball	- How does package management work? Is there a .json or .yaml file that describes the packages for a project?
2018-03-06 19:34:01	nedbat	fresheyeball: we don't mind easy questions, but some things are better answered by tutorials.  You will probably like pipenv as a tool.
2018-03-06 19:34:35	dimino	wow yeah for some reason __str__() specifically returns none
2018-03-06 19:34:48	nedbat	dimino: that's messed up
2018-03-06 19:35:07	fresheyeball	nedbat: fair enough, is there one you would recommend? My goal is to have a hello world thing, with tensor flow, building and executing in the next couple hours
2018-03-06 19:35:24	dimino	I think it's because message=None here in the init
2018-03-06 19:35:24	dimino	https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/blob/master/aiohttp/client_exceptions.py#L123
2018-03-06 19:35:39	dimino	muy mal
2018-03-06 19:36:14	nedbat	fresheyeball: did you try something like this? https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/
2018-03-06 19:36:35	grym	fresheyeball: tensorflow's API is kind of gnarly, but their github page has some example stuff and docker containers that should walk you through e.g., classifying MNIST in about a day
2018-03-06 19:36:45	grym	fresheyeball: https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials  is also not too bad
2018-03-06 19:36:48	▷	grym heads home 
2018-03-06 19:37:29	fresheyeball	ok looking at getting started
2018-03-06 19:37:40	fresheyeball	nedbat: it wants me to install pandas with pip
2018-03-06 19:37:41	ali1234	nedbat: okay, thanks :)
2018-03-06 19:37:52	fresheyeball	I refuse to do that, since I can't commit it to git
2018-03-06 19:38:01	nedbat	fresheyeball: i don't understand the connection
2018-03-06 19:38:16	fresheyeball	that is an imperative package install command
2018-03-06 19:38:28	fresheyeball	it will just install panda on my system
2018-03-06 19:38:41	fresheyeball	now my project does document that dependency
2018-03-06 19:38:45	fresheyeball	doesn't*
2018-03-06 19:38:48	nedbat	fresheyeball: how do you propose to install tensorflow?
2018-03-06 19:38:59	nedbat	fresheyeball: ok, then put that in your requirements file.
2018-03-06 19:39:04	fresheyeball	I don't know
2018-03-06 19:39:10	fresheyeball	ok requirements files are a thing!

2018-03-06 19:41:35	TwistedBlizzard	I've narrowed the cause down to the fact that the change in font size is causing a window resize which in turn is causing a font resize etc. Is there any way to break this cycle?
2018-03-06 19:41:52	newbiepython1	nedbat: Here is my java implementation where i am trying to connect with dynamodb and fields. I wanted to change to python , if you could guide me for a couple of methods , and i would follow for the rest. https://paste.pound-python.org/show/xFx89NoypPWNPbDPe6sX/
2018-03-06 19:42:45	nedbat	newbiepython1: do you have any python code yet?

2018-03-06 19:57:52	nedbat	newbiepython1: there's no private or public in python. you don't need getters and setters because you just have an attribute on an object. simple.

2018-03-06 20:43:29	Remics	This is for python 3.6 and I've tried grabbing it from pip as well as building it from source
2018-03-06 20:43:32	arooni	disi: that isntalls still via python3
2018-03-06 20:43:58	disi	arooni: wierd... maybe you need to use `python2` then instead of just `python`
2018-03-06 20:46:46	tos9	Remics: Works for me -- can you show what you ran
2018-03-06 20:47:28	tos9	Remics: _cffi_backend is a module you get from installing it, so if you don't have it, your install is somehow broken
2018-03-06 20:48:09	Jonno_FTW	if I use Popen(stderr=tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)), how can I read the contents of the stderro back fromt he file?
2018-03-06 20:48:16	Remics	tos9: So, it works on my machine, but ultimately this is from an AWS lambda function
2018-03-06 20:49:03	Remics	I need cryptography (cffi is a dependency) and tried to grab it from multiple linux docker containers
2018-03-06 20:49:12	Jonno_FTW	p.stderr is None after the subprocess is ccreated
2018-03-06 20:49:19	arooni	disi: i thuink that worked;  what is the -m pip thing
2018-03-06 20:49:33	arooni	i.e. python -m pip versus just a pip install
2018-03-06 20:50:03	Xano	I'm using `with NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+t')` in a test that must write to the file. However, no matter how I try (f.write() and f.flush(), or print(file=f)), f.read() always shows the file as empty. What am I doing wrong?
2018-03-06 20:50:14	disi	arooni: python -m will look for a module and run it... using pip this way ensures you are aware of the version of python that is associated with the pip you are using
2018-03-06 20:50:21	tos9	Remics: Sounds like however you're installing it in lambda is incorrect
2018-03-06 20:50:24	Remics	cffi mentions it in their docs, so I tried their method without success
2018-03-06 20:50:27	Remics	http://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html?highlight=_cffi_backend
2018-03-06 20:51:10	Remics	tos9: Double checked all of that. If that was an issue it would be throwing fits about other modules
2018-03-06 20:51:21	tos9	Remics: Why is that
2018-03-06 20:51:35	disi	arooni: there is a classic issue where someone does pip install foo then runs python and cannot import foo... and it usually happens because pip is pointed at some other python than they expect
2018-03-06 20:52:08	arooni	disi: how can i see all files installed in that package?  something is supposed to be added as an executable and i cant find it

2018-03-06 20:52:42	tos9	Remics: If you're missing _cffi_backend, something is installed incorrectly
2018-03-06 20:52:55	tos9	Remics: If it works on your local machine, it's installed correctly there, and not in AWS :)
2018-03-06 20:53:36	Remics	tos9: I understand your thinking (installing correctly may be correct), but been there, checked that
2018-03-06 20:53:59	Remics	It would throw a fit over cryptography first

2018-03-06 20:56:49	Remics	tos9: I'll run some test code inside the container
2018-03-06 20:57:21	disi	arooni: you coudl also try running pip uninstall and examing the list of things it plans to delete (it asks are you sure)
2018-03-06 20:57:23	tos9	Remics: The fact that package A was installed correctly has literally 0 to do with B
2018-03-06 20:57:42	tos9	Remics: I'm not saying that's 100% your issue, but it's about 85% your issue, and it's odd that you'd be stubborn about it considering you're here asking for how to fix it :)
2018-03-06 20:58:30	Remics	tos9: Just saying I've been down that road. I'm not the first one to have this issue and it was discussed it's an issue with cffi
2018-03-06 20:58:45	Remics	I'll keep digging, see if I can come up with something
2018-03-06 20:59:41	Remics	Sorry for my fustration. Spent way too long on this and it shows :/
2018-03-06 21:00:22	tos9	Remics: No worries -- if you want my best guess on what *might* be happening with my magic crystal ball -- are you building some sort of artifact that you ship to lambda, rather than pip installing on lambda (I don't remember whether it lets you do that)
2018-03-06 21:00:36	tos9	If you are, you likely are building a cffi that's trying to do the wrong things on the target architecture

2018-03-06 21:02:25	Remics	So, under normal circumstances I'd do pip install cryptography in a virtualenv and since cffi is a dependency it would be installed along with it

2018-03-06 22:19:49	_habnabit	snacks, sorry i don't have a more satisfying answer here
2018-03-06 22:20:46	_habnabit	snacks, the keyword to search for on how to work around this irritating problem is 'setup_requires'. i think the easiest solution is to `pip install setuptools_scm` into your virtualenv and try again
2018-03-06 22:20:57	_habnabit	snacks, (you can do that pip install with your same flags, if you want)

2018-03-06 22:35:21	energizer	you dont normally need pip3 anyway
2018-03-06 22:36:04	deniska	I spell `pip` like `python3.6 -m pip`
2018-03-06 22:36:24	cyp3d	many keypress
2018-03-06 22:36:25	deniska	or sometimes `py -m pip`
2018-03-06 22:36:34	energizer	i spell pip `pipenv`
2018-03-06 22:36:43	energizer	or sometimes `pip` (if venv activated)
2018-03-06 22:36:51	deniska	cyp3d: you have time to really think through whether you need to run pip while you type it that way :)
2018-03-06 22:37:07	TML	cluelessperson: self.checksum is initialized to None on line 16, and then is never set to anything else, so the conditional "if self.checksum != checksum:" will never pass
2018-03-06 22:37:14	cyp3d	I've been on the venv train, but I wonder sometimes if I should start using conda
2018-03-06 22:37:18	▷	deniska also prefers not to activate venvs

2018-03-06 22:40:50	cluelessperson	TML:   Well, __main__   runs everything.   import config,   stream = CameraStream()  starts a thread in the background that polls the camera when new images are available

2018-03-06 22:41:27	ocb	hello, i'm looking for a python function that can pass multiple arbitrary arguments to a remote python script, but the remote script isn't accepting input of those arguments through a command line. at the moment, to write a single argument out of 3 i'm doing an echo like this; x = commands.getstatusoutput('echo "' + str(argument1) + '" | ./remote_script.py [..snip..]')
2018-03-06 22:41:28	energizer	deniska: aye. i guess i should just alias py='pipenv run python'
2018-03-06 22:41:43	CannedSpinach	what does it mean if I'm uninstalling with pip and I get "No such file or directory: " with what looks like a link to an egg file?
2018-03-06 22:41:55	CannedSpinach	I have installed and uninstalled this package multiple times and I get the error on every uninstall
2018-03-06 22:41:55	energizer	ocb: what's a remote script?
2018-03-06 22:42:02	ocb	is it somehow possible to do echo and use new line \n to send another argument
2018-03-06 22:42:42	ocb	energizer: sorry, i've described it in a wrong way.. it's a script i'm not allowed to edit but it's on the local system
2018-03-06 22:42:43	TML	cluelessperson: I meant at a lower level - e.g., I've never used threading in Python, I've no idea what "Lepton" is, etc.
2018-03-06 22:43:02	ocb	hey cluelessperson, you're here too :)
2018-03-06 22:43:22	energizer	ocb: can you install the package of the other script?
2018-03-06 22:44:01	TML	ocb: if it doesn't accept them on the command-line, how are you passing them?
2018-03-06 22:44:11	ocb	energizer: i can, but how would that work?
2018-03-06 22:44:28	energizer	ocb: install it and then just call the function you need?
2018-03-06 22:44:30	cluelessperson	TML: Lepton is a company.  FLIR Lepton Camera is a thermal camera, 60x80 pixels, for $250.  They just came out with the Lepton 2 that's double the resolution. :P
2018-03-06 22:44:49	ocb	TML: at the moment I can pass only a single argument doing a pipe from echo "argument1" | python3 script.py
2018-03-06 22:44:56	cluelessperson	ocb: sup
2018-03-06 22:45:30	energizer	ocb: oh you're running the script from bash?
2018-03-06 22:45:35	TML	ocb: Can you share the code of script.py so we can understand what it's expecting?
2018-03-06 22:46:38	ocb	TML: it's a project of over 100k lines of code. it's accepting the argument through a sys.argv
2018-03-06 22:46:56	ocb	energizer: i'm running it from python with commands package
2018-03-06 22:47:00	ocb	x = commands.getstatusoutput('echo "' + str(argument1) + '" | ./remote_script.py [..snip..]')
2018-03-06 22:47:29	ocb	i'm not a regular python user so might be explaning not that well
2018-03-06 22:48:15	ocb	i jsut want to pass two more arguments where sys.argv is waiting for input
2018-03-06 22:48:29	energizer	ocb: oh well if you're in python and you want to use another python package, you can just install it, import it, and call the function from within your original python process
2018-03-06 22:48:38	TML	ocb: `echo "argument1" | python3 script.py` is not sys.argv
2018-03-06 22:49:05	nedbat	ocb: can you pastebin the actual lines where you use getstatusoutput?
2018-03-06 22:49:08	TML	ocb: sys.argv is `python3 script.py argument1 argument`
2018-03-06 22:49:09	⚡	McKraken is now known as McKraken_zzzzz
2018-03-06 22:49:48	energizer	you can use xargs for this, but this seems like a weird approach
2018-03-06 22:50:25	energizer	nedbat: how would you feel about python=python3 after py2 EOL?
2018-03-06 22:50:54	TML	ocb: so since it's not sys.argv, we have to wonder what rules it IS using for parsing different options - for example, is it expecting to read them as a space-separated string? Encoded as a Python dict? etc.
2018-03-06 22:50:55	nedbat	energizer: i understand why people want to make python mean 3.  But it breaks things during the transition.
2018-03-06 22:51:11	energizer	nedbat: but after?
2018-03-06 22:51:33	nedbat	energizer: whenever you make the switch, for whatever reason, there will be breaking.
2018-03-06 22:51:53	nedbat	energizer: it's a classic tradeoff between what's good for new users, and what's good for existing users.
2018-03-06 22:52:23	ocb	TML: needed a minut to check the code as it's not my code, it's using raw_input()
2018-03-06 22:52:45	energizer	nedbat: so when (if ever) should the distros switch, in your view?
2018-03-06 22:53:12	nedbat	energizer: i don't know that there is a good answer to that question
2018-03-06 22:54:01	nedbat	energizer: i don't have a simplistically strong opinion for you :)  perhaps I don't belong on IRC :) :)
2018-03-06 22:54:20	energizer	nedbat: hahaha 🔥🔥🔥
2018-03-06 22:54:22	cluelessperson	nedbat: energizer just make the packaging system expose that option to users
2018-03-06 22:54:29	cluelessperson	tell them to start flipping the switch themselves
2018-03-06 22:54:35	TML	ocb: That's why I asked you to post the script, so we can help you decode how it expects arguments
2018-03-06 22:55:03	nedbat	ocb: is the code on github or bitbucket somewhere?
2018-03-06 22:55:26	ocb	nedbat: https://github.com/gurnec/btcrecover
2018-03-06 22:55:58	TML	ocb: and you're trying to run 'btcrecover.py'?
2018-03-06 22:55:59	nedbat	ocb: you know most of the password to your bitcoin wallet?
2018-03-06 22:56:28	ocb	TML: trying to run seedrecover.py
2018-03-06 22:56:50	ocb	nedbat: yes correct, most of the seeds actually
2018-03-06 22:58:03	justanotheruser	whats the best way to convert a datetime (or other object) to a json-encodable object generically
2018-03-06 22:58:11	TML	ocb: OK, so here's your problem: you don't want to run `echo "…" | python3 seedrecover.py`, you want to run `python3 seedrecover.py …`
2018-03-06 22:58:24	dchudz	so, while we're having fun with 2/3, I've been wondering what things will look like at big companies still using python2 in 2020
2018-03-06 22:58:28	justanotheruser	I guess just manually traverse the dict and apply functions based on type?
2018-03-06 22:58:49	altendky	justanotheruser: maybe marshmallow or such
2018-03-06 22:59:07	dchudz	will they all actually transition? will they not, and it won't matter? will they pay someone to maintain the libraries that the current maintainers will stop maintaining?
2018-03-06 22:59:17	justanotheruser	yeah, I think marshmallow will have what I need
2018-03-06 22:59:23	justanotheruser	thanks
2018-03-06 22:59:49	TML	ocb: So that probably looks something like `x = commands.getstatusoutput('seedrecover.py {}'.format(' '.join(list_of_arguments))`
2018-03-06 22:59:54	ocb	TML, no i want to pipe some text to seedrecover.py script... that works, piping a single text works, but when the seedrecover.py script wants another raw_input.. i can't input it automatically
2018-03-06 23:00:21	TML	ocb: seedrecover.py doesn't read from raw_input
2018-03-06 23:00:41	ocb	btcrseed.py search for mnemonic_guess = raw_input("Please enter your best guess for your mnemonic (seed)\n> ")
2018-03-06 23:00:44	nedbat	dchudz: i think plenty of people continue to run software that isn't being maintained.
2018-03-06 23:00:56	TML	oh - you told me the wrong command
2018-03-06 23:01:04	dchudz	nedbat: hmm, makes sense, thanks
2018-03-06 23:01:45	cluelessperson	justanotheruser: timestamp
2018-03-06 23:01:56	cluelessperson	justanotheruser: google python datetime get timestamp
2018-03-06 23:02:22	altendky	dchudz: I believe the python folks have volunteered to let others have access to the official py2 repo if they wanted to maintain it
2018-03-06 23:02:30	justanotheruser	I know how to encode a datetime to json serializable, that's not what I asked
2018-03-06 23:02:38	TML	ocb: are you using subprocess?
2018-03-06 23:03:06	▷	CrtxReavr just spend way too freak'n long finding a ( in the wrong place.
2018-03-06 23:03:35	nedbat	altendky: really?
2018-03-06 23:03:35	dchudz	altendky: not surprising. that's the kind of thing that's gotten me curious what will happen. It's a little hard to imagine people maintaining it for fun. So if anyone does, it'll probably be on company time, right? (or paid by a foundation companies fund?)
2018-03-06 23:03:36	TML	ocb: That is to say, is "commands.getstatusoutput" by any chance actually "subprocess.getstatusoutput"?
2018-03-06 23:03:45	grym	CrtxReavr: http://www.bash.org/?7748
2018-03-06 23:04:07	ocb	TML: it's commands.getstatusoutput not a subprocess
2018-03-06 23:04:09	dchudz	so I've been curious if it'll give us interesting new models for open source, which sounds neat (except for the part about being python2,  which doesn't sound neat)
2018-03-06 23:04:42	CrtxReavr	grym, that would be easy to find though, 'cause it would be a syntax error.
2018-03-06 23:04:58	TML	ocb: Unfortunately, I don't know anything about the commands module, and I no longer have python2 to test anything for you
2018-03-06 23:05:11	CrtxReavr	This was proper python syntax. . . and I looked at it a million times without seeing the problem.
2018-03-06 23:05:19	ocb	TML: thank you anyways for spending your time to help a stranger .)
2018-03-06 23:06:47	CrtxReavr	grym, nevermind what a named.conf with ~20k sets of {}s is doing in /usr/src/bind
2018-03-06 23:07:01	grym	CrtxReavr: i dunno, 1997 was a weird time
2018-03-06 23:07:22	TML	ocb: at a guess, you might try putting all the words in a text file and try `x = commands.getstatusoutput('seedrecover.py < thatfile.txt')`
2018-03-06 23:07:38	CrtxReavr	'Course. .. no linux distro out there actually bothers to follow hier(7).
2018-03-06 23:07:59	CrtxReavr	Yet another reason I prefer BSD.

2018-03-06 23:26:22	dchudz	Hmm, is there something different about when `PYTHONWARNINGS="error::Warning"` triggers a new SyntaxError that means I can't ignore it from particular modules? (triggers different interpreter behavior that can't be controlled that way?)
2018-03-06 23:26:25	dchudz	Detailed example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49144064/ignore-python-syntaxerror-coming-from-pythonwarnings-errorwarning (I was just going to ask this on StackOverflow and not here, but SO made me really sad by telling me "Questions with similar titles have frequently been downvoted and/or closed ...")

2018-03-06 23:38:59	nedbat	dchudz: you can't ignore a syntaxerror. It isn't a warning, it's an error

2018-03-06 23:39:27	nedbat	a
2018-03-06 23:39:53	dchudz	nedbat: makes sense, thanks. pretty frustrating b/c I want to turn on `PYTHONWARNINGS="error::Warning"`, and for the most part I can ignore deprecation warnings in dependencies...
2018-03-06 23:40:02	dchudz	... but the SyntaxError has me pretty stuck
2018-03-06 23:40:16	nedbat	dchudz: make a pull request against the dependency
2018-03-06 23:41:17	dchudz	yeah, will do. I was about to file an issue, but the reproduction is weird: my minimal reproduction doesn't reproduce unless I touch the file where it happens
2018-03-06 23:41:30	dchudz	I guess some cached/compiled version doesn't trigger the error
2018-03-06 23:41:31	Grange	Hi all. I have a problem in indexing numpy array. Say I have 2 RGB images of same dimension (e.g. 100x100x3). I can get the indices for the channels with the largest value in image A by `idx=np.argmax(A,axis=2)`, which is (100x100). How do I index image B using this `idx`?
2018-03-06 23:41:42	dchudz	(or something, dunno)
2018-03-06 23:44:05	TML	dchudz: add 'PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1' to your command invocation
2018-03-06 23:45:38	dchudz	TML: hmm, same result
2018-03-06 23:46:03	TML	dchudz: PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONWARNINGS="error::Warning,ignore::DeprecationWarning" python3.6 -c "import has_deprecated_syntax" # works here
2018-03-06 23:46:28	TML	dchudz: if __pycache__ already exists, you may need to delete it first
2018-03-06 23:48:34	dchudz	TML: I think you're not getting the error for a different reason from PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE
2018-03-06 23:48:41	dchudz	`PYTHONWARNINGS="error::Warning,ignore::DeprecationWarning" python3.6 -c "import has_deprecated_syntax"` doesn't get the error either
2018-03-06 23:48:49	TML	dchudz: Right
2018-03-06 23:48:58	dchudz	but also doesn't accomplish what I'm looking for, because it would mean ignoring the DeprecationWarning everywhere
2018-03-06 23:49:02	TML	dchudz: PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE prevents the *OTHER* problem
2018-03-06 23:49:06	dchudz	ohhhh
2018-03-06 23:49:21	dchudz	the problem with the error not reproducing?
2018-03-06 23:49:54	TML	yes
2018-03-06 23:51:01	TML	and I apologize on the DeprecationWarning - I thought you were saying you were ok with supressing those
2018-03-06 23:51:40	TML	I read "for the most part I can ignore deprecation warnings in dependencies" as "I want to supress all DeprecationWarning"
2018-03-06 23:51:49	dchudz	no problem, I appreciate it
2018-03-06 23:52:53	dchudz	TML: ...but I still don't think PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE helps with the repro for this example

2018-03-06 23:54:52	TML	dchudz: if you add PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 on the FIRST time you call python, you should never GET a __pycache__, which means the problem will be reproducible

2018-03-06 23:56:13	dchudz	TML: hmm, even the first time in a new virtualenv, `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` didn't repro it
2018-03-06 23:56:54	TML	dchudz: is there a __pycache__ there? That might be created by some other step.
2018-03-06 23:57:34	dchudz	yeah, maybe in the pip install
2018-03-06 23:57:43	`7hr34t_hvntr	hi
2018-03-06 23:57:55	dchudz	removing that __pychache__ doesn't help repro it... but maybe some other one somewhere else in the package is responsible
2018-03-06 23:57:56	`7hr34t_hvntr	what's the quickest way to time execution of a line of code in python
2018-03-06 23:58:01	TML	dchudz: Seems a bit extreme, but you could maybe try prepending something like `find . -name '__pycache__' -delete` before the python call
2018-03-06 23:58:08	`7hr34t_hvntr	the timeit module is sort of cryptic/overly complicated
2018-03-06 23:58:46	`7hr34t_hvntr	i just want a time at start and time at end. i guess a datetime.datetime.now() at start and end would be a quick hack
2018-03-06 23:59:00	energizer	`7hr34t_hvntr: start_time = datetime.now() ; do_stuff() ; end_time = datetime.now() ; print(end_time - start_time)
2018-03-06 23:59:10	`7hr34t_hvntr	sick thanks
2018-03-07 00:00:34	dchudz	TML: so, not even that did it :P oh well, I'm sure I've taken enough of your time helping me repro this thing that's easier to just submit a PR to fix
2018-03-07 00:00:41	dchudz	thanks though!
2018-03-07 00:01:41	dchudz	TML: oops, actually that did do it
2018-03-07 00:01:45	dchudz	good call :-)
2018-03-07 00:06:20	`7hr34t_hvntr	earlier someone mentioned in here that if i calculated the md5sum of a binary with pythons hashlib, there is no chance of triggering a payload
2018-03-07 00:06:37	`7hr34t_hvntr	is anyone able to corroborate or explain why
2018-03-07 00:06:50	foo	I realized my code is organized poorly, as it relates to file structure. So is this the way you might do it? https://paste.ofcode.org/3bkZudKNvM36yAnfAugSgmP - this just seems redundant: ~/Code/myapp/myapp/myapp/ - Curious on how others might approach this... maybe it doesn't really matter
2018-03-07 00:07:53	mandeep	foo: why split myapp into a subpackage?
2018-03-07 00:08:02	mandeep	im not saying it's wrong. just curious
2018-03-07 00:08:03	⚡	LogicAside is now known as ThatOtherGuy
2018-03-07 00:08:09	jorvis	Trying to understand how to use someone else's function which has **kwargs.  It looks like this:  def violin(save=None, ax=None, **kwargs):    But when I call it like this: violin(save="foo.png", linewidth=0.3) I get an error: TypeError: violin() got an unexpected keyword argument 'linewidth'
2018-03-07 00:08:21	jorvis	I thought the point of **kwargs was to take the additional keyword arguments.
2018-03-07 00:08:30	monoprotic	jorvis: hm.
2018-03-07 00:08:49	mandeep	jorvis: where is ax
2018-03-07 00:08:52	monoprotic	jorvis: can you share the code
2018-03-07 00:09:46	jorvis	monoprotic:  Here's the other person's code:  https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blob/master/scanpy/plotting/anndata.py#L347
2018-03-07 00:09:47	foo	mandeep: thank you. As I understand it, this is the correct way: https://github.com/kennethreitz/samplemod - to structure. If you agree with that, then it looks like they put it in a subpackaged? I think I need one level since venv is generally not tracked in git, so I think that needs to be a layer before... but maybe not?
2018-03-07 00:10:17	mandeep	foo: is venv your virtual environment for the project?
2018-03-07 00:10:32	foo	mandeep: yes
2018-03-07 00:10:39	jorvis	monoprotic:  And my call is like this:  https://gist.github.com/jorvis/5e9681ae669aa9d3c9f2ce3f2941588c
2018-03-07 00:10:40	mandeep	foo: dont include it in version control
2018-03-07 00:10:58	ouemt	I'm reading a file and use next(f) a few times in a place where I might be at the end of the file. How should I handle StopIteration Exceptions?
2018-03-07 00:10:58	mandeep	sorry i mean dont include it in your project
2018-03-07 00:11:03	foo	mandeep: I don't, I have it in a parent dir. I'm curious, can you edit this: https://paste.ofcode.org/3bkZudKNvM36yAnfAugSgmP - to show how you normally structure?
2018-03-07 00:11:13	foo	mandeep: ah, right, right, ok, then that's good
2018-03-07 00:11:22	jorvis	mandeep:  ax was an optional param
2018-03-07 00:11:39	mandeep	foo: that way you dont have to worry about another myapp subpackage
2018-03-07 00:11:41	mandeep	jorvis: i see
2018-03-07 00:12:14	foo	mandeep: so you would normally put docs/tests in ./ with the rest of the package within ./ ?
2018-03-07 00:12:14	TML	jorvis: https://glot.io/snippets/eyxpw8ebmb # wfm?
2018-03-07 00:12:24	foo	mandeep: then we just have ~/Code/myapp/myapp/
2018-03-07 00:12:46	mandeep	foo: hang on ill edit the paste. what is included in docs and tests? just documentation and tests?
2018-03-07 00:12:48	jorvis	Sorry, what is 'wfm?'
2018-03-07 00:13:10	foo	mandeep: yup, trying to get a basic idea - I have a ton of code actually organized *not* like this, curious to see what you come up with
2018-03-07 00:13:40	mandeep	foo: https://paste.ofcode.org/a5wb3tjFucGeQqzNmhxkK8
2018-03-07 00:13:42	TML	jorvis: "works for me"
2018-03-07 00:14:13	foo	mandeep: so you have your venv in ~/venv/
2018-03-07 00:14:16	`7hr34t_hvntr	earlier someone mentioned in here that if i calculated the md5sum of a binary with pythons hashlib, there is no chance of triggering a payload
2018-03-07 00:14:17	mandeep	foo: yep
2018-03-07 00:14:21	`7hr34t_hvntr	is anyone able to corroborate or explain why
2018-03-07 00:14:38	jorvis	TML:  Hmm, trying to see what is different.  Thanks.
2018-03-07 00:14:41	foo	mandeep: in practice, then, isn't root probably ~/myapp/myapp ? Since you probably have a venv specific to your project?
2018-03-07 00:15:28	monoprotic	jorvis: **kwargs was added to that function in the repository 6 days ago
2018-03-07 00:15:29	mandeep	foo: i dont understand what you mean by ~/myapp/myapp
2018-03-07 00:15:48	monoprotic	jorvis: are you using an older version?
2018-03-07 00:16:03	mandeep	you mean hypothetically the project is located in ~?
2018-03-07 00:16:04	jorvis	monoprotic:  Dude, that's a hell of a find.
2018-03-07 00:16:17	mandeep	monoprotic: going the extra mile
2018-03-07 00:16:19	jorvis	monoprotic - well done.
2018-03-07 00:16:31	monoprotic	jorvis: https://github.com/theislab/scanpy/blame/master/scanpy/plotting/anndata.py#L347 blame feature is useful if you don't know it
2018-03-07 00:17:15	foo	mandeep: eg. you put your app in ~/root/myapp/. If you have your venv in ~/venv/, then do you have a ~/venv specific to this project? And don't you name it appropriately so you know which project it's associated with? I'm thinking, on my local laptop, if you use docker or such I suppose this doesn't matter. eg. Let's say I have 5 projects, each has their own venv. I'd have my own ~/myapp/venv/ and ~/myapp/myapp/ - right?
2018-03-07 00:17:42	jorvis	monoprotic:  I don't know it, know, but will search and read.  Thanks again.
2018-03-07 00:17:49	monoprotic	np
2018-03-07 00:17:56	mandeep	foo: no because venv isnt stored in your project
2018-03-07 00:18:14	mandeep	foo: but yes on the myapp/myapp if the first myapp is your project root
2018-03-07 00:18:21	foo	mandeep: right, it's stored before my project, but I still want to categorize it somehow so I know which project it's associated with
2018-03-07 00:20:13	foo	mandeep: To be more clear, I'm on OS X, on my dev machine right now
2018-03-07 00:20:21	mandeep	foo: im not really sure how venv works but for my virtualenvs i use ./virtualenv/myapp
2018-03-07 00:21:17	foo	mandeep: ohhh, so you're installing your app as a package inside your python environment - correct?
2018-03-07 00:21:28	mandeep	foo: yep with pip install -e
2018-03-07 00:21:49	foo	mandeep: Interesting, and you do dev/edit inside of myapp?
2018-03-07 00:21:54	mandeep	yep
2018-03-07 00:22:03	foo	mandeep: Is that pretty common practice?
2018-03-07 00:22:17	foo	(Can anyone else speak to this?)
2018-03-07 00:22:18	mandeep	from my limited experience yes
2018-03-07 00:22:26	mandeep	but hopefully others can chime in
2018-03-07 00:24:19	foo	mandeep: small backstory... I am looking into line_profiler. To use it, I'd have to run my code with python myapp/start.py or such. The problem is, I've been running my code with python -m ... so I do python -m myapp.start    - and inside of myapp/start.py, it does from myapp import othermod .... and if I'm following correctly, it makes more sense to just import othermod, not from myapp import othermod, does that make sense?
2018-03-07 00:25:11	mandeep	foo: yeah line_profiler is awesome. instead of using python -m install your package with pip install -e and use your entrypoint to run the program
2018-03-07 00:25:33	mandeep	im not sure what you mean about the imports though
2018-03-07 00:25:37	foo	mandeep: yeah, and to do that I need setup.py, I believe. Short version: I have some learning and refactoring to do, ha.
2018-03-07 00:25:52	mandeep	foo: yep setup.py is needed :)
2018-03-07 00:26:16	mandeep	_habnabit: has a blog post about packaging but i can never remember it
2018-03-07 00:26:22	foo	mandeep: with imports, my mods do: from myapp import somemod, since I always run python -m myapp.start ... as opposed to just doing python -m start (inside myapp)
2018-03-07 00:26:50	mandeep	from myapp import whatever is fine
2018-03-07 00:27:21	mandeep	but entrypoints will make your life easier

2018-03-07 02:33:19	energizer	MaximB: yes
2018-03-07 02:33:20	MaximB	cuz I'm still getting that error
2018-03-07 02:33:22	BlueShark_	odinsbane, why should it normally happen?
2018-03-07 02:33:25	MaximB	same error
2018-03-07 02:33:35	MaximB	ValueError: Length mismatch: Expected axis has 1 elements, new values have 3 elements
2018-03-07 02:33:39	BlueShark_	under what circumstances do pymysql throw this error?
2018-03-07 02:34:13	foo	deniska: thank you :) I set the PYTHONPATH and was able to get line_profiler to run... I think I'll focus less on this now. :) Good to know python -m is often the way to go!
2018-03-07 02:34:38	energizer	MaximB: are you running a new python process? i just tried it over here and it worked
2018-03-07 02:35:08	energizer	MaximB: try it in an interactive shell like ipython
2018-03-07 02:35:13	odinsbane	BlueShark_: trying execute with a cursor that has been closed.
2018-03-07 02:35:36	odinsbane	BlueShark_: it is usually easier to go the other way, you show us what you did, and where the error happens.
2018-03-07 02:37:24	MaximB	energizer: i see that the filenames are different. headers.csv = columns.txt ?
2018-03-07 02:37:55	odinsbane	MaximB: line 8 gives you an error?
2018-03-07 02:38:15	energizer	MaximB: yeah sure, make appropriate adjustments
2018-03-07 02:38:33	MaximB	i did, but yeah still the same error odinsbane
2018-03-07 02:38:35	MaximB	energizer:
2018-03-07 02:38:51	odinsbane	I'm am just surprised that line 8 causes an error.
2018-03-07 02:39:21	odinsbane	MaximB: Also, did you check the dimensions of what you're reading after you've read it?
2018-03-07 02:39:50	MaximB	what do you mean? both files have 3 'columns'
2018-03-07 02:39:57	MaximB	o wait
2018-03-07 02:39:58	foo	energizer: thank you
2018-03-07 02:40:09	MaximB	the headers file got 3 values in one column
2018-03-07 02:40:10	energizer	MaximB: https://i.imgur.com/UNPI0j4.png
2018-03-07 02:40:14	MaximB	that might be the issue
2018-03-07 02:40:37	odinsbane	What does colnames look like after you read it?
2018-03-07 02:41:36	MaximB	['First', 'Second', 'Third']

2018-03-07 02:42:04	energizer	MaximB: print(data.columns)
2018-03-07 02:42:11	BlueShark_	odinsbane, I am using this decorator function - http://dpaste.com/32QQNKQ - to retry the MySQL operation in case there is any issue while executing the query.
2018-03-07 02:42:37	BlueShark_	@retry_mysql_operation_on_connection_failure - I add this before every function that does any database interactions.
2018-03-07 02:44:01	odinsbane	You're using a global connection?
2018-03-07 02:45:06	MaximB	https://apaste.info/yAoe  I think the firt zero in data cases the problem
2018-03-07 02:45:10	BlueShark_	odinsbane, I'm using the local connection if global connection fails.
2018-03-07 02:45:12	odinsbane	Where are you getting your interface error?
2018-03-07 02:45:19	MaximB	energizer:
2018-03-07 02:45:26	odinsbane	BlueShark_: are you?
2018-03-07 02:45:36	energizer	MaximB: data.columns
2018-03-07 02:46:13	MaximB	Int64Index([0], dtype='int64')
2018-03-07 02:46:28	deniska	foo: PYTHONPATH? I don't have emoji input thingie available on this computer, so imagine a pile of poo yourself :)
2018-03-07 02:46:43	AlwaysHigh	what a good python db package simple is fine like a json db
2018-03-07 02:47:08	deniska	AlwaysHigh: sqlite is nice for 98% of things you would want to use a json thing for
2018-03-07 02:47:10	AlwaysHigh	im just wanting to store data for how many times someone say something in an irc channel

2018-03-07 02:48:20	BlueShark_	odinsbane, I'm getting an interface error.
2018-03-07 02:48:26	energizer	MaximB: im not sure what's happening. you can see in my imgur link how to do it
2018-03-07 02:48:35	BlueShark_	The logs show this: DEBUG: Error in function: function_name_which_has_db_interactions

2018-03-07 02:49:08	BlueShark_	(0, '') tuple means an interface error I think, correct?
2018-03-07 02:49:12	odinsbane	BlueShark_: you're using a global connection.
2018-03-07 02:49:25	odinsbane	tuple doesn't mean that.
2018-03-07 02:49:43	BlueShark_	what does it mean?
2018-03-07 02:49:59	odinsbane	nothing, it is a tuple.
2018-03-07 02:50:34	MaximB	energizer: how does your headers file look like?
2018-03-07 02:50:42	energizer	MaximB: it's in the image
2018-03-07 02:52:02	MaximB	energizer: maybe because your data file has a ',' separator? (mine got tab separator)
2018-03-07 02:52:38	energizer	MaximB: read_csv(..., sep='\t')
2018-03-07 02:55:17	⚡	kevr` is now known as kevr
2018-03-07 03:00:25	BlueShark_	odinsbane, yup, i am using global. using local only if global fails.
2018-03-07 03:00:42	BlueShark_	odinsbane, so why might this error be happening?
2018-03-07 03:01:22	re1	has anyone worked with Graphene here? I have simple model schema for my SQLAlchemy table and it works but it returns IDs as base64 encoded strings
2018-03-07 03:01:33	re1	how can I serialize them back as integers (just as they are in the database)?
2018-03-07 03:01:47	odinsbane	BlueShark_: Where do you use local? In what you pasted you only used global. You have a connection, that probably fails then you retry.
2018-03-07 03:01:59	MaximB	energizer: interesthing, I've tested the code with ',' separator like in your example and it works, but not with tab separator. even trough I did:
2018-03-07 03:02:00	MaximB	data = pd.read_csv('data.csv', sep='\t', header=None)
2018-03-07 03:02:37	energizer	MaximB: there's another option called something like delim_whitespace=True iirc, check the read_csv docs
2018-03-07 03:02:46	odinsbane	BlueShark_: Also, you never start the connection. The first thing you do is perform the operation. Where do you open the connection?
2018-03-07 03:03:01	energizer	MaximB: you'd do that instead of sep=, not with it
2018-03-07 03:04:03	MaximB	energizer: thanks, it did the trick
2018-03-07 03:05:30	energizer	MaximB: good! :)
2018-03-07 03:06:56	Xano	I'm using `with NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w+t')` in a test that must write to the file. However, no matter how I try (f.write() and f.flush(), or print(file=f)), f.read() always shows the file as empty. What am I doing wrong?
2018-03-07 03:07:56	MaximB	best channel ever!!
2018-03-07 03:09:07	odix	hey guys, if im trying to install key bindings for a c program in windows ... how do i do this ? it wa so much easier in linux. anyway, there is somethign made in C called libkeyfinder...and somebody made a wrapper in python for it. How do i do this ?
2018-03-07 03:09:09	odix	im confused
2018-03-07 03:09:55	BlueShark_	odinsbane, the connection is defined globally. when it tries to execute the sql operation, i am catching that and trying to create the connection again INSIDE the decorator.
2018-03-07 03:10:36	odix	also dos in windows telsl my a module isnt installed, when clearly pip tells me it is
2018-03-07 03:11:06	odix	ImportError: No module named aubio - C:\Users\PSI\Desktop\python audio>pip install aubio
2018-03-07 03:11:06	odix	Requirement already satisfied: aubio in c:\users\psi\appdata\local\programs\python\python36-32\lib\site-packages
2018-03-07 03:11:19	odinsbane	BlueShark_: yes. That is what you are doing. You have a global connection, that doesn't get created INSIDE your decorator, unless your sql function fails. If your sql function fails, then the GLOBAL connection gets intitialized and your sql function gets called again.
2018-03-07 03:11:27	odinsbane	BlueShark_: that is all kinds of broken.
2018-03-07 03:12:29	odinsbane	Does your sql function create/handle the connection? Clearly it is throwing an exception, and your decorator is doing something that seems pretty much irrelevant.
2018-03-07 03:12:33	BlueShark_	odinsbane, what is the correct way to do it then?
2018-03-07 03:13:37	odinsbane	BlueShark_: I don't know what your function looks like. Do you want to handle the connection in the decorator, or in the function you're calling?
2018-03-07 03:20:46	odinsbane	BlueShark_: It is really speculative for me on your design, but. You should have 1 function that opens the connection, and 1 function that closes it. When you make a series of calls it should be, openConnection; doWork; moreWork; closeConnection; Then, if you are getting an exception in the doWork/moreWork phase, you need to look at why.

2018-03-07 03:23:31	odinsbane	BlueShark_: you don't even need to redesign anything, but what you have pasted isn't enough to tell what is going on. Probably the doWork function you are calling is closing the connection. Then the moreWork funtion is trying to use a closed connection.

2018-03-07 03:44:09	odinsbane	BlueShark_: I see what you're doing, but you haven't pasted enough information to see if you're doing it correctly. But, your terminology is off. You are assigning the global connection in your decorator.
2018-03-07 03:48:34	odinsbane	BlueShark_: Also, you might want to conside this change http://dpaste.com/11R6KFP
2018-03-07 03:49:35	odinsbane	BlueShark_: I switched the wait interval and the new connection because otherwise you are creating the connection THEN waiting 5 seconds.

2018-03-07 16:57:16	disi	I would guess vector is closer to list/tuple than dict
2018-03-07 16:57:57	grym	vectors are lists

2018-03-07 17:11:38	henk124875	@nedbat basically that is the full error report above that it's just traceback that stops with the add_torrent command which is where i add the dict/list to the params
2018-03-07 17:12:44	DaPinkOne	Zartanian: it's either not installed, or the path to the executable is not in your PATH environment variable.
2018-03-07 17:13:20	DaPinkOne	the installer should've done that for you though
2018-03-07 17:13:48	Zartanian	it is installed, that i know. i just don't know the next step to take, as i said, i'm very very new to programing.
2018-03-07 17:14:07	nedbat	henk124875: it really might be helpful to pastebin the whole error report.
2018-03-07 17:14:23	Zartanian	that was the whole report...
2018-03-07 17:14:27	DaPinkOne	Zartanian: this is less programming, and more general system knowledge

2018-03-07 17:15:44	DaPinkOne	Zartanian: the installer sets the environment variable for you, if you check the box.
2018-03-07 17:16:11	DaPinkOne	or you can follow https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html and figure it out
2018-03-07 17:17:07	Zartanian	no, i just have the standard cmd... tried running as administrator as well. changed from c:\users\admin to c:\windows\system32
2018-03-07 17:17:28	DaPinkOne	Zartanian: what do you mean you have the standard cmd?

2018-03-07 17:18:16	Zartanian	i mean its just the regular cmd prompt box, nothing special or changed in it. standard paths
2018-03-07 17:18:45	DaPinkOne	Zartanian: yes. when you install a program, if cmd is going to find it, that program's location has to be in the PATH environment variable.
2018-03-07 17:19:14	DaPinkOne	when you run a program, cmd searches through the locations in PATH, and if it doesn't find it, it returns your error message.
2018-03-07 17:20:19	DaPinkOne	the python 3 installer should change this variable for you, if you check the checkbox for that, or you can do it manually. The python 2 docs which I linked walk through how to set an environment variable.
2018-03-07 17:20:49	henk124875	@nedbat, never mind i just had to put the raw content of the file in there.. i didn't need to bdecode it
2018-03-07 17:34:26	Zartanian	ok, got it to stop giving me an error, it was the path variable. now though, i can't get it to run the script. this is the script location "C:\Users\Guest\Desktop\Thomas\script.py" but when i enter it i get "SyntaxError: unexpected character after line continuation character"

2018-03-07 17:47:11	bjs	FrostRobin1: you don’t call the parent __init__ is the only weird thing
2018-03-07 17:47:45	bjs	so you might be getting some kind of attribute error if not careful
2018-03-07 17:48:07	bjs	on slots

2018-03-07 17:49:28	dunk	bjs: I think that the ast module skips things like comments, so wouldn't be so useful for editor plugin development?

2018-03-07 18:06:14	energizer	FrostRobin1: what's your goal? when should a SortedInventory be sorted? what should be the sorting criteria?
2018-03-07 18:06:41	nedbat	FrostRobin1: it would be better if the child used the parent method, but these two seem so intertwined, it's hard to say
2018-03-07 18:08:01	FrostRobin1	nedbat, yeah thats what I was strugling with I dont want to change Inventory add_item() method but I want SortedInventory to act differently So I just ignored using super
2018-03-07 18:09:16	FrostRobin1	energizer, Well the goal isnt entirely clear yet I just wanted a simple class for inventory and sorted inventory.  But im thinking about sorting common items separately from rare
2018-03-07 18:12:20	snowcatman	monoprotic: i guess i need to pastebin all the code .html and .php and the .py so you can read threw it in order to understand what i am doing. this worked for another server. and i was migrating to flask. to see if it was faster in controlling motors https://pastebin.com/2qtM9xhm

2018-03-07 18:12:42	charking	Hello.  When you use foo.stdout.read() to read output in Python 3 (foo = subprocess.Popen(...)), it returns a bytes-like value.  How can I get a normal string so I can call strings methods on it?
2018-03-07 18:13:14	charking	Python 3.6.1
2018-03-07 18:13:26	monoprotic	snowcatman: sending a php file to a client as a static file won't actually run any of the php that was written
2018-03-07 18:13:44	monoprotic	charking: you can decode it if you know the encoding
2018-03-07 18:15:50	snowcatman	monoprotic: i know verry little of what i am doing. just scrapping by. i know i was calling system to send a command to a service. dont know how to do that in flask
2018-03-07 18:16:29	charking	monoprotic: Thanks.  Is there a simpler way to do what I'm trying to do?  Having to mess with character encoding just to process some output from a command in a script seems complex
2018-03-07 18:17:27	monoprotic	snowcatman: im saying that the php file you have there needs to be processed by php on the server somewhere. flask can't do that for you
2018-03-07 18:17:58	runciter	charking: you have to know the encoding of bytes to decode them to text
2018-03-07 18:18:00	monoprotic	snowcatman: i see your code on a stackoverflow answer but as the comments on that answer say, php cant be sent as a static file
2018-03-07 18:18:07	runciter	charking: you can do what a lot of people do and pretend it's utf-8
2018-03-07 18:18:17	runciter	so that would be Popen(..., encoding='utf-8', ...)
2018-03-07 18:18:39	monoprotic	snowcatman: most people who work with php will serve it with apache, or maybe nginx
2018-03-07 18:19:07	runciter	this is what python does for its own stdin, out, and err, so you'd be in good company
2018-03-07 18:19:36	charking	runciter: When you pipe output from one command to another in Bash, you don't have to explicitly specify a character encoding.  Why do you have to in Python?
2018-03-07 18:20:04	charking	Maybe shell=True would solve this..?
2018-03-07 18:20:09	runciter	it won't
2018-03-07 18:20:10	monoprotic	no
2018-03-07 18:20:17	grym	shell=True usually un-solves things
2018-03-07 18:21:00	grym	charking: you do, in bash.  it's usually `$LANG`
2018-03-07 18:21:01	runciter	charking: because the default string type in python 3 is unicode, whereas it was bytes in python 3.  bash works in terms of bytes, like python 2.
2018-03-07 18:21:31	runciter	bash doesn't impose any encoding on child process' standard input and outputs
2018-03-07 18:21:39	runciter	err, i mean it was bytes in python 2*
2018-03-07 18:24:01	charking	OK, thanks, I think I understand.  So a program could output something other than UTF-8, like Unicode, and then you would need to decode accordingly
2018-03-07 18:24:20	monoprotic	eh
2018-03-07 18:24:24	runciter	you always need to decode the output of the program if you want it as text
2018-03-07 18:24:32	runciter	you can often get away with decoding it as utf-8
2018-03-07 18:24:33	grym	^
2018-03-07 18:24:52	runciter	if you can't, you need to choose the correct encoding, which you must already know
2018-03-07 18:25:09	KirkMcDonald	charking: "something other than UTF-8, like Unicode" Unicode is not an encoding.
2018-03-07 18:25:26	charking	UTF-16 :)
2018-03-07 18:25:35	runciter	some programs actually output bytes, like `gzip --stdout-out`.  don't try to turn that into text
2018-03-07 18:25:56	KirkMcDonald	I could argue that UTF-16 isn't an encoding either. (BE or LE?)
2018-03-07 18:26:16	nedbat	just put the full-stop after "argue" :)
2018-03-07 18:26:24	charking	I see.  Thanks for explaining.  I am hazy on character encodings.  I think in this case I can use encoding='utf-8' as you suggest.
2018-03-07 18:26:33	KirkMcDonald	nedbat: Yes, true, we can take this as a given.
2018-03-07 18:28:02	runciter	charking: pretend it's like JSON.  in python 3, the data you receive from your subprocess is like the string `{"a": 1}`.  you have to decode it with `json.loads` to get a python dictionary so you can do `d['a']` to get at the `1`.
2018-03-07 18:28:59	runciter	charking: the same is true for bytes and text; the data you receive from your subprocess isn't a python string, so you have to decode it with the right encoding to get one.  unlike the JSON example, were we know the format of `{"a": 1}`, there are many possible text encodings
2018-03-07 18:29:41	charking	runciter: Makes sense, thanks.  I have done JSON decoding/encoding
2018-03-07 18:44:12	foo	I have some sort of string like this: 'foo T <foo@omp.com>, foo i <ddi@gmail.com>' - pulled directly from an e-mail header's CC. Is there a package to help me make sense of this and split this up into name / email? I could process this with regex but wondering if there is something a little more evolved than that
2018-03-07 18:44:13	johnflux_	I have a byte array that contains a mix of binary code, and shift-js encoded bytes
2018-03-07 18:44:36	johnflux_	can anyone think how I could extract the japanese strings from this
2018-03-07 18:46:46	runciter	foo: email.utils.getaddresses(['foo T <foo@omp.com>, foo i <ddi@gmail.com>'])
2018-03-07 18:46:56	runciter	https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.util.html#email.utils.getaddresses
2018-03-07 18:50:42	jayjo	I am using asyncio to connect to a unix socket, and on detecting an error I will run a method like asyncio.get_event_loop().call_later(delaySecs, self.connect). If the connection is able to be re-established it appears to work (if I terminate the server I will get error messages while trying to recconect but when the server is re-established I don't get an error). I get the error RuntimeError: This event
2018-03-07 18:50:47	foo	runciter: aha! Thank you
2018-03-07 18:50:48	jayjo	loop is already running ... I think this exposes my some of my misunderstanding. How do I grab the current event loop to run a method later?
2018-03-07 18:52:29	jayjo	here are the three relevant methods of my client.py: https://bpaste.net/show/3dfe6fe9b864
2018-03-07 18:53:21	runciter	jayjo: you can't recursively call run_until_complete
2018-03-07 18:53:42	johnflux_	how can I partially-collapse a list
2018-03-07 18:53:53	monoprotic	johnflux_: like what?
2018-03-07 18:54:05	runciter	jayjo: where do you call _on_api_error
2018-03-07 18:54:05	johnflux_	I have a list like:    ['a','b','c','0','1']    and I want to group letters and numbers :    ['abc','01']
2018-03-07 18:54:17	jayjo	runciter: so I need to somehow pass self.connect_async instead of self.connect()?
2018-03-07 18:54:18	johnflux_	(without reordering the list)
2018-03-07 18:54:31	johnflux_	I have a list like:    ['a','b','c','0','1','d']    and I want to group letters and numbers :    ['abc','01','d']
2018-03-07 18:54:44	monoprotic	johnflux_: itertools has some things that might help. like groupby
2018-03-07 18:55:07	stealth_	johnflux_, for i in mylist: if i.isdigit(): #number else: # string
2018-03-07 18:55:34	runciter	jayjo: well, how are you calling _on_api_error
2018-03-07 18:55:54	nedbat	johnflux_: where did the list come from?
2018-03-07 18:56:00	z1phr	Anyone have a pyqt webengine example of taking a website, deleting an object and feeding it to pyqt webengineview?
2018-03-07 18:56:28	johnflux_	nedbat: it's a raw byte string.  I'm trying to group valid unicode strings, and leave invalid unicode strings as hex
2018-03-07 18:56:41	johnflux_	nedbat: (and other encodings)
2018-03-07 18:56:53	z1phr	I basically want to do what you can do with 'inspect element' in chrome browsers for example only automatically and show it in webengineview...
2018-03-07 18:56:56	runciter	johnflux_: why?
2018-03-07 18:57:03	nedbat	johnflux_: why isn't it a string?
2018-03-07 18:58:12	johnflux_	because it's a mix of computer code as well.  it's a data file from a game
2018-03-07 18:58:25	runciter	better write a parser
2018-03-07 18:58:25	jayjo	runciter: the relevant lines are 35 and 108 (https://bpaste.net/show/d9398b798db7) - so I'm calling it in connect_async if there is an error
2018-03-07 18:58:32	nedbat	johnflux_: oh, finding the shift-jis strings in the binary blob
2018-03-07 18:58:38	johnflux_	nedbat: exactly
2018-03-07 18:58:50	nedbat	johnflux_: that will be tricky: shift-jis doesn't have invalid sequences, right?
2018-03-07 18:59:51	runciter	jayjo: get rid of _on_api_error, wrap the try/except in a loop, and do: await asyncio.sleep(delaySecs); continue
2018-03-07 19:00:09	johnflux_	nedbat: it does, but it's complicated.  best thing is to simply try to decode and see if it fails :)
2018-03-07 19:01:06	runciter	johnflux_: i suggest writing a parser for the file's format
2018-03-07 19:02:47	johnflux_	runciter: I don't know the file's format
2018-03-07 19:02:58	jayjo	runciter: do you mean  while: continue?
2018-03-07 19:02:58	newbiepython1	can someone help me walk through my java to python code that i am trying to convert. let me know if anyone can join this live pair coding and i can show the code .  here is the url to join http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit&togetherjs=7ps1egMolr
2018-03-07 19:03:05	jef79m	[''.join(g) for x, g in groupby(mylist, lambda x: x.isdigit())] thanks monoprotic I didn't know about groupby.
2018-03-07 19:03:16	runciter	jayjo: yeah, sorry, i meant 'wrap it in a while loop'
2018-03-07 19:03:32	⚡	deathonater is now known as Smeef
2018-03-07 19:04:14	runciter	johnflux_: :(  maybe you can avoid implementing a whole parser, but there are probably cues in the format about when a string is coming up that you can look for
2018-03-07 19:04:44	johnflux_	jef79m: thanks, that looks good
2018-03-07 19:06:19	newbiepython1	can someone help me walk through my java to python code that i am trying to convert. let me know if anyone can join this live pair coding and i can show the code .  here is the url to join http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit&togetherjs=7ps1egMolr
2018-03-07 19:06:27	jef79m	johnflux_ except probably swap that first 'x' for a '_'
2018-03-07 19:06:41	jef79m	to stop confusment when you read it later.
2018-03-07 19:08:08	jayjo	runciter: I apologive for my dense-ness - https://bpaste.net/show/d2811dd66934 like this?
2018-03-07 19:08:32	jayjo	I only use continue in for loops typically
2018-03-07 19:09:15	runciter	jayjo: if the connection is successful, then `break` (so at the end of the `try` block or better yet in an `else` block)
2018-03-07 19:09:19	⚡	[codemonkey] is now known as trollmonkey
2018-03-07 19:09:34	runciter	jayjo: that way the loop will continue until a successful connection
2018-03-07 19:10:32	runciter	jayjo: so if there's never an exception, the loop completes in one iteration
2018-03-07 19:13:40	johnflux_	how can I look over an iterator twice?  should I turn it into a list?
2018-03-07 19:13:54	monoprotic	thats one way
2018-03-07 19:13:58	⚡	trollmonkey is now known as [codemonkey]
2018-03-07 19:14:20	jayjo	ok - that makes perfect sense. I was incorrect that that's the only place I was calling _on_api_error, it is actually also referenced in _on_socket_disconnected_callback and _socket_has_error_callback (lines 205 and 220 of https://bpaste.net/show/d9398b798db7)
2018-03-07 19:14:35	monoprotic	johnflux_: there's also itertools.tee which could be more sutiable for certain conditions
2018-03-07 19:15:13	jayjo	What you just walked me through will continue to attempt to connect after I call connect. My problem is after a connection is established and there is an error somehow to reference my event loop and call connect again while the event loop is running
2018-03-07 19:15:24	johnflux_	I tried to modify jef79m's code to output a list of dicts
2018-03-07 19:15:26	johnflux_	https://pastebin.com/0bBtYhVe

2018-03-07 19:15:36	nedbat	newbiepython1: please don't repeat questions too frequently.
2018-03-07 19:15:45	johnflux_	(so that I have the original code as hex, as well as the translated string)
2018-03-07 19:15:50	runciter	jayjo: just `await self.connAsync`
2018-03-07 19:15:57	johnflux_	but it fails because I'm iterating over "g"  twice
2018-03-07 19:16:45	monoprotic	johnflux_: yeah. you could makea  function that accepts a group and iterates with a loop or making a list first
2018-03-07 19:18:27	johnflux_	okay I just used a for loop instead :-)
2018-03-07 19:18:30	johnflux_	that fixed it
2018-03-07 19:18:37	johnflux_	thanks all!

2018-03-07 19:18:58	monoprotic	:)
2018-03-07 19:19:18	jayjo	runciter: but I am not able to put an await self.connectAsync in _socket_disconnected_callback for example
2018-03-07 19:20:15	jayjo	similarly that's why I had initially used asyncio.get_event_loop().call_later(), but that's where the error orginiated
2018-03-07 19:20:30	runciter	jayjo: wrap it in a Task

2018-03-07 19:26:57	jayjo	runciter: using asyncio.get_event_loop().create_task()?
2018-03-07 19:27:41	jayjo	and just replace it in the _on_api_error from the initial start?

2018-03-07 19:33:58	nosklo	`7hr34t_hvntr: you send a request to the server using rest. Then instead of waiting in a thread you carry on with your code.
2018-03-07 19:34:10	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: and you import a python library?

2018-03-07 19:40:25	`7hr34t_hvntr	i didnt say i needed non blocking, i just wanted to append all the results from each set of mutually exclusive API calls to the same list. but i can actually append them to their own lists if that avoids some blocking issue.
2018-03-07 19:40:34	nedbat	`7hr34t_hvntr: or maybe it will, sort of? I wouldn't do it.
2018-03-07 19:40:55	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: then just do one and then do the next. No threads, no async.
2018-03-07 19:41:04	jayjo	_habnabit: the Connection Refused error is correct and supposed to happen, I'm not handling my re-connection attempts properly with asyncio
2018-03-07 19:41:25	`7hr34t_hvntr	altendky, right, that was my solution to avoid threads
2018-03-07 19:41:28	jayjo	Although if I reestablish my server process I will reconnect
2018-03-07 19:41:35	_habnabit	jayjo, why does line 75 call loop.run_until_complete ?
2018-03-07 19:41:46	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: why did you even consider threads?
2018-03-07 19:42:29	`7hr34t_hvntr	well, actually, i wanted to launch off 4 sets of searches in the same python module @altendky
2018-03-07 19:43:19	`7hr34t_hvntr	but i was thinking if i didnt use threads, propgram flow would halt at each search instead of doing them all at the same time
2018-03-07 19:43:19	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: so the calls are slow and you are trying to parallelize them to get them done faster?
2018-03-07 19:43:24	`7hr34t_hvntr	yes

2018-03-07 19:44:03	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: do you know that parallel calls actually get you results faster?
2018-03-07 19:44:30	`7hr34t_hvntr	not for a fact but it's a near certainty
2018-03-07 19:45:25	`7hr34t_hvntr	would have to test to be sure, but im pretty confident it'd be the case
2018-03-07 19:45:28	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: then back to the how big is this API question. And, how useful is the library abstraction from the raw http requests
2018-03-07 19:46:00	jayjo	_habnabit: it's a wrapper method to run from line 117. I had also used it to force a syncronous connection in a jupyter notebook before, but I don't believe it's referenced anywere else
2018-03-07 19:46:26	`7hr34t_hvntr	it's a large API, and it'd probably take a good couple of weeks for me to figure out how to turn it into raw requests
2018-03-07 19:46:32	_habnabit	jayjo, clearly it is! one of your futures' callbacks is calling it
2018-03-07 19:46:56	_habnabit	jayjo, line 117
2018-03-07 19:48:29	jayjo	right - I had mentioned line 117... otherwise I would prefer to only connect asynchronously. but because _on_api_error is not an async function I cannot use await syntax, so I tried a roundabout way of getting it executed (definitely not the appropriate way to do it)
2018-03-07 19:48:33	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: tell the author they should have an async version... And verify that 5 copies of your program run simultaneously and requesting different things actually do finish significantly faster than when called sequentially
2018-03-07 19:49:52	jayjo	which I believe is what I'm trying to figure out (and I say what I believe I'm trying to figure out because I'm not entirely sure if that's where my problem stems - I know I want to try connect_async again but I'm trying to hit it from a non async def method)
2018-03-07 19:50:02	`7hr34t_hvntr	altendky, thanks
2018-03-07 19:50:23	_habnabit	jayjo, did you see runciter say to use a task?
2018-03-07 19:50:29	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: also keep in mind that a large library may have internal state and not be thread safe
2018-03-07 19:50:52	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: so ask about that too
2018-03-07 19:50:56	`7hr34t_hvntr	i could just do subprocess.popen calls
2018-03-07 19:51:16	`7hr34t_hvntr	and open up a few copies of the search, split by time frames
2018-03-07 19:51:29	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: and then you have to serialize etc
2018-03-07 19:52:09	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: what is the input to be parallelized and the output to be collected
2018-03-07 19:52:36	jayjo	I did. So in _on_api_error I did task = asyncio.get_event_loop().create_task(self.connect_async(...)), but i'm struggling to await the task in a non-async def function
2018-03-07 19:52:37	`7hr34t_hvntr	output is nothing but a list
2018-03-07 19:52:44	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: of...
2018-03-07 19:52:49	`7hr34t_hvntr	strings
2018-03-07 19:53:06	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: and input?
2018-03-07 19:53:15	_habnabit	jayjo, why are you awaiting the task?
2018-03-07 19:53:18	`7hr34t_hvntr	also strings that specify search criteria
2018-03-07 19:53:38	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: how many requests overall?
2018-03-07 19:54:04	`7hr34t_hvntr	10k
2018-03-07 19:54:06	`7hr34t_hvntr	takes about 10 mins
2018-03-07 19:54:17	_habnabit	`7hr34t_hvntr, maybe just use gnu parallel
2018-03-07 19:54:37	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: that's where I was getting...
2018-03-07 19:54:44	▷	`7hr34t_hvntr head explodes
2018-03-07 19:55:17	▷	altendky is unsure if that's good or bad
2018-03-07 19:55:22	nedbat	`7hr34t_hvntr: the api doesn't give you a more sophisticated search that does what you need with fewer requests?
2018-03-07 19:57:53	altendky	Maybe I should make a python package with parallel in it for easy dependencies and deployment
2018-03-07 19:58:35	altendky	And a twisted wrapper I guess
2018-03-07 19:59:40	jayjo	_habnabit: ok, so it seems like it was only a fundamental misunderstanding of asyncio that was causing the problem
2018-03-07 20:00:17	_habnabit	jayjo, yep. run_until_complete is a mistake and a misfeature
2018-03-07 20:00:57	jayjo	create_task will run automatically, correct? The only time I await them is if I want their return value? And in this case I don't, I just need to make sure I handle its exception somehwere along the line?
2018-03-07 20:01:38	_habnabit	jayjo, respectively: the future will be run by the event loop, yes. yes. yes.
2018-03-07 20:03:10	jayjo	_habnabit: thank you, you've saved me a lot of frustration for the umpteenth time
2018-03-07 20:03:23	jayjo	It looks to be working smoothly
2018-03-07 20:03:30	_habnabit	jayjo, asyncio is pretty confusing. sorry
2018-03-07 20:03:38	_habnabit	i would not call it good software
2018-03-07 20:03:38	aw1	is it possible to list the extras_require component of a package using pip?
2018-03-07 20:04:04	_habnabit	aw1, not.. exactly? piptools has something i think
2018-03-07 20:04:19	aw1	_habnabit, thanks.

2018-03-07 20:15:34	altendky	If I have a pyqt GUI with twisted canbus networking, what would be a good option for ipc if split to multiple processes? For that interface data would be mostly bidirectional value updates (uuid or path-like string keys and number values)?
2018-03-07 20:16:57	_habnabit	altendky, my favorite is still capnproto
2018-03-07 20:16:59	altendky	Longer term, remote connections might be nifty
2018-03-07 20:17:26	altendky	_habnabit: I forget, there is a twisted lib?
2018-03-07 20:17:40	_habnabit	altendky, oh, right.. i'm not sure if there is yet
2018-03-07 20:19:14	_habnabit	altendky, libcapnp has an event loop in it, for Reasons
2018-03-07 20:19:33	altendky	_habnabit: it is used by defining the protocol and generating code for the target language, right? As opposed to runtime parsing of a protocol definition
2018-03-07 20:20:19	_habnabit	altendky, the reference implementation has a runtime that the generated code uses which also has an event loop in the runtime
2018-03-07 20:20:41	_habnabit	altendky, i don't know if you can use its socket support without it at the moment, or if there's an alternate implementation
2018-03-07 20:22:15	jayjo	if I use asyncio.get_event_loop().create_task(), it just creates Task and return immediately, and because my event loop is running asyncio will execute the task as soon as it can. I'd like to handle the exception. (similar to this question: https://stackoverflow.com/q/37001733) Is it going to be possible to catch the exception in a function that is not defined with async def?
2018-03-07 20:22:48	jayjo	Because I cannot await the task in the function unless it is defined with async def syntax
2018-03-07 20:23:20	altendky	_habnabit: anything decent to suggest that plays nice with twisted already?  I don't need high performance. We have a low load on a 500kbps bus so... At least for the primary case
2018-03-07 20:24:03	_habnabit	altendky, i don't know, offhand. in twisted-land the canonical answer can be 'AMP' but i'm less happy with it over the years
2018-03-07 20:26:56	_habnabit	jayjo, no, because it's not raised in any function. you can _handle_ it, but you can't _catch_ it like with a try-except
2018-03-07 20:27:19	altendky	_habnabit: would redis make any sense since it's basically a bunch of key value pairs? Just need to be notified when the other side changes it. If I were to add remote access then I guess multiple gui's
2018-03-07 20:27:43	_habnabit	altendky, maybe? i don't remember how redis subscriptions work
2018-03-07 20:30:10	Ninpo	Doesn't redis have publisher channels or whatever they're called that can notify you on content change

2018-03-07 21:04:02	mutante	using argparse and parser.add_argument to add an argument with 2 positional arguments.  how do you set  'metavar' for 2 args .. and not repeat it twice
2018-03-07 21:04:45	_habnabit	mutante, put it in a dictionary and use **kw? also i recommend using click over argparse always: http://click.pocoo.org/6/
2018-03-07 21:05:47	mutante	ok, thanks. nevermind then. i appreciate it but "use something else and rewrite the code" wasn't what i was planning to do right now
2018-03-07 21:05:49	Zartanian	that was it, i mustve had an older version in my clipboard when i made the script, lol

2018-03-07 21:12:59	Ninpo	(not to say there aren't any, hence my curiosity)
2018-03-07 21:17:13	_habnabit	Ninpo, it's optparse with a few horrible hacks used to shoehorn in arguments and subcommands. as soon as you get >1 level of subcommands, it's a nightmare. it's in the standard library, so they fix bugs and make changes periodically and you can't rely on users all having the same version (so i had to vendor/backport argparse from 3.4 for users on 2.7/3.3)
2018-03-07 21:17:39	_habnabit	Ninpo, http://click.pocoo.org/6/why/#why-not-argparse
2018-03-07 21:17:45	Ninpo	reading that atm
2018-03-07 21:18:18	Ninpo	And I'm at "I've not run into that problem yet". I'll bear the recommendation in mind, thanks :)
2018-03-07 21:18:58	_habnabit	Ninpo, in general i find argparse to be way too much boilerplate for any case where `arg1, arg2 = sys.argv[1:]` isn't enough
2018-03-07 21:19:40	KirkMcDonald	I see some merit in the notion that features in a command-line parser are mostly a mistake.
2018-03-07 21:19:59	_habnabit	KirkMcDonald, define 'features'
2018-03-07 21:21:17	grym	click does slightly too much magic for me to be comfortable with it.  Docopt does just the right amount of magic, most of the time
2018-03-07 21:21:32	_habnabit	grym, i hate docopt with an intense passion
2018-03-07 21:21:42	grym	_habnabit: excellent!
2018-03-07 21:21:55	grym	it's good to have a wealth of opinions
2018-03-07 21:22:14	KirkMcDonald	_habnabit: I don't really have a firm definition here... But, in a general sense, I get wary when an API starts encompassing a lot of logic that can also be written as just, you know, code.
2018-03-07 21:22:43	_habnabit	grym, i can't say i always agree, given that the reason i hate docopt is that it was a broken mess and i had to replace it in a bunch of programs an ex-coworker wrote
2018-03-07 21:22:51	_habnabit	grym, so by extension i hate anyone who uses it
2018-03-07 21:23:03	monoprotic	hah
2018-03-07 21:23:05	grym	_habnabit: aw, and i thought we were buddies!
2018-03-07 21:23:07	grym	oh well
2018-03-07 21:23:12	KirkMcDonald	I, too, have an intense dislike of docopt, for reasons not entirely unlike why I say doctests are a terrible idea.
2018-03-07 21:24:50	KirkMcDonald	_habnabit: Also re: too many features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUFwk1Ibwkc
2018-03-07 21:25:07	_habnabit	KirkMcDonald, not sure what you mean re: logic/code. click in particular doesn't expose a lot of things in its API for defining logic beyond a few common patterns. anything more complex, the answer is 'use a callback'

2018-03-07 21:30:43	KirkMcDonald	energizer: This is hard to say. Mostly I look at argparse and I see something with few opinions, that wants to solve all problems, and this annoys me a little.

2018-03-07 21:39:48	DanielPowerNL	Hi, I need some help with import organization. I'm using SQLAlchemy to manage the database for a Flask app. This is all working well, but I want to write an abstraction module between my app and SQLAlchemy. The issue is that SQLAlchemy models require a database instance to exist upon declaration (they take arguments from the database instance on declaration). I need to find a clean way to wait until after creating a Database instance to define
2018-03-07 21:39:48	DanielPowerNL	the Model classes.
2018-03-07 21:40:32	energizer	DanielPowerNL: you can make sqlalchemy models without a db
2018-03-07 21:41:52	_habnabit	energizer, not a good idea
2018-03-07 21:42:21	DanielPowerNL	energizer, how do I pass the data type to the Columns? Currently I'm declaring them as `title = db.Column(db.String(140))` where db is an instance of SQLAlchemy. If I replace `db` with `SQLAlchemy`, I get `SQLAlchemy has no entry Column` or something along those lines.
2018-03-07 21:42:30	energizer	_habnabit: explicit is better than implicit, nuff said? or something more
2018-03-07 21:43:04	energizer	DanielPowerNL: what do you mean db is an instance of SQLAlchemy?
2018-03-07 21:43:28	DanielPowerNL	energizer, `db = SQLAlchemy(app)`

2018-03-07 21:43:56	_habnabit	energizer, well, that's one reason, which is similar to the reason why you don't make a function that takes 'a scalar or a vector' and does isinstance checks or whatever to determine what you passed: the caller knows their context, and you're saying "NOPE, I KNOW BETTER" and guessing what the context is instead of just directly asking the caller to tell you
2018-03-07 21:43:59	syntaxman	I've looked at the online docs, and can't find __requires__ anywhere
2018-03-07 21:44:18	_habnabit	syntaxman, it's not a thing. someone just added that as metadata
2018-03-07 21:44:43	_habnabit	energizer, the other reason is that this code is embarrassingly trivial. how does it handle returning a value, instead of just doing IO?
2018-03-07 21:46:53	altendky	_habnabit: it seems odd to have to have a connected DB prior to defining classes and functions that might use those classes. Seems like it would make testing etc a mess. Am I missing something?
2018-03-07 21:47:01	_habnabit	altendky, eh?
2018-03-07 21:47:05	DanielPowerNL	energizer, this is the error I'm running into when I try to pass SQLAlchemy instead of a db created with `db = SQLAlchemy(app)`, AttributeError: type object 'SQLAlchemy' has no attribute 'Model'
2018-03-07 21:48:01	energizer	DanielPowerNL: what is SQLAlchemy?
2018-03-07 21:48:10	altendky	_habnabit: continuing the sqlalchemy topic. I made that little?
2018-03-07 21:48:15	altendky	Little sense
2018-03-07 21:48:27	_habnabit	altendky, why are you asking me..?
2018-03-07 21:48:36	energizer	altendky: do you mean DanielPowerNL ?
2018-03-07 21:48:59	altendky	_habnabit: because you were saying it was a good thing to have the DB first, I thought
2018-03-07 21:49:02	DanielPowerNL	energizer, SQLAlchemy is a middle-layer for databases. It lets you interact with different databases (in my case SQLite) using classses, instead of writing SQL code.
2018-03-07 21:49:14	_habnabit	altendky, i don't know what line you're talking about
2018-03-07 21:49:26	energizer	DanielPowerNL: i mean what is the `SQLAlchemy` object?
2018-03-07 21:49:36	jfhbrook	lolol
2018-03-07 21:49:40	altendky	21:41 <_habnabit> energizer, not a good idea
2018-03-07 21:49:56	_habnabit	altendky, scroll back a few lines
2018-03-07 21:50:34	altendky	_habnabit: I mixed conversations?  Sorry
2018-03-07 21:50:52	altendky	DanielPowerNL: there is a page about this issue, I'll try to find it
2018-03-07 21:51:50	DanielPowerNL	energizer, Are you asking about the object in the error message? It's the result of `from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy`
2018-03-07 21:52:08	DanielPowerNL	energizer, I'll look at the documentation for that, one minute.
2018-03-07 21:52:17	energizer	DanielPowerNL: oh it's flask_sqlalchemy.SQLAlchemy, i see.
2018-03-07 21:52:37	DanielPowerNL	Sorry, I should have specified that.
2018-03-07 21:52:59	energizer	DanielPowerNL: anyway, you can make models with sqlalchemy.String()
2018-03-07 21:53:11	energizer	DanielPowerNL: s/models/columns
2018-03-07 21:55:07	DanielPowerNL	energizer, where am I getting sqlalchemy from? `SQLAlchemy has no attribute Model`. Do I need to import something else?
2018-03-07 21:55:22	ConsoleFx_	Would it be feasible to change the font_face in PyCharm (2017.3) for Debugger window? I could change the font_face for the Console Output though.
2018-03-07 21:57:13	DanielPowerNL	Ah, sqlalchemy does have String and Integer. But no Model.
2018-03-07 21:59:25	qu4ku	trying to install python 3.6 on ubuntu server and it's a nightmare :( - pip3 doesn't work - problems with ssl
2018-03-07 21:59:44	_habnabit	qu4ku, show us
2018-03-07 22:00:12	qu4ku	'pip is configured with locations that require TLS/SSL, however the ssl module in Python is not available.'
2018-03-07 22:00:30	_habnabit	qu4ku, oh, you're trying to do python from source
2018-03-07 22:01:46	qu4ku	_habnabit yes, and python 3.6.4 works
2018-03-07 22:02:01	_habnabit	qu4ku, apparently not! anyway, use nixpkgs or pyenv
2018-03-07 22:04:41	qu4ku	_habnabit what's the better way to install python3 other than from a source?
2018-03-07 22:04:48	_habnabit	qu4ku, nixpkgs or pyenv
2018-03-07 22:05:18	grym	qu4ku: and also install libssl-dev :)
2018-03-07 22:05:24	sydbarret	I need a scrypt that retrieve all site links containing certain word and also all the external links. Whats the best approach?
2018-03-07 22:06:01	grym	qu4ku: as well as header packages for readline, bzip, sqlite3, and  one other that i always forget
2018-03-07 22:06:16	grym	qu4ku: ubuntu-server is unlikely to already have them
2018-03-07 22:11:53	_habnabit	i'm pretty sure pyenv automates/helps with these things
2018-03-07 22:11:59	_habnabit	nixpkgs obviates it entirely
2018-03-07 22:13:06	grym	it does not
2018-03-07 22:13:11	grym	(pyenv does not)
2018-03-07 22:13:31	grym	it just provides a clean build toolchain, it can't apt-get stuff
2018-03-07 22:13:41	grym	but it does clean up failed builds in a tidy way
2018-03-07 22:25:53	energizer	DanielPowerNL: im talking about `import sqlalchemy`
2018-03-07 22:26:54	theWhisper_	hi all
2018-03-07 22:27:27	monoprotic	hey
2018-03-07 22:29:37	altendky	DanielPowerNL: I can't say I know if these were working but perhaps these two branches of a demo flask app a friend and I were working on would point out sooner interesting stuff https://github.com/dr5801/url_shortener/blob/fixdb/src/urlshortener/database_model.py  https://github.com/dr5801/url_shortener/blob/unittest/src/urlshortener/application.py#L11  also note the blueprints for the flask side of things

2018-03-07 22:36:20	dtux	what happened during sept 2016 and jan 2018? https://gist.github.com/dmtucker/da7fadb79c705020a03e552f81dac0b8
2018-03-07 22:38:00	energizer	dtux: i bet its a big distro release
2018-03-07 22:42:30	dtux	energizer: doesnt seem like ubuntu or centos
2018-03-07 22:43:55	dtux	it may be correlated to python2
2018-03-07 22:44:30	energizer	dtux: what's the --where clause?
2018-03-07 22:45:37	energizer	dtux: look like you can group by distro https://github.com/ofek/pypinfo#downloads-for-a-project-by-system-and-distribution
2018-03-07 22:45:38	dtux	energizer: that should match any download where the user agent reported itself as python 1.17
2018-03-07 22:46:29	energizer	maybe d stufft knows
2018-03-07 22:46:39	dtux	energizer: 1.17 downloads are always None for system, distro, installer, installer version , impl, impl version
2018-03-07 22:46:50	dtux	energizer: ive talked to him about it
2018-03-07 22:47:12	dtux	seems like it probably originates from urllib in python2
2018-03-07 22:47:23	energizer	interesting
2018-03-07 22:47:24	dtux	but the download counts are declining like python2 downlaods
2018-03-07 22:47:33	dtux	are NOT declining

2018-03-07 22:49:04	energizer	dtux: oo nice
2018-03-07 22:49:07	`7hr34t_hvntr	so bck to a question i had earlier, was trying to figure out how to make rest API calls in parallel using python. i want to run ten mutually exclusive searches at once, and print results to stdout
2018-03-07 22:49:24	`7hr34t_hvntr	some folks mentioned gnu parallel but my host is windows
2018-03-07 22:49:34	`7hr34t_hvntr	apparently threading is wrong as well
2018-03-07 22:50:19	monoprotic	`7hr34t_hvntr: 10 HTTP calls to a remote server?
2018-03-07 22:50:32	`7hr34t_hvntr	i wanted to append results to the same list, but considering chance of collisions, i could split up results into 10 lists and concatenate when done.
2018-03-07 22:50:37	`7hr34t_hvntr	right it's remote.
2018-03-07 22:51:11	⚡	twandy1 is now known as twandy
2018-03-07 22:51:30	nosklo	threading seems the solution at first glance, but it will bring you problems in the future `7hr34t_hvntr
2018-03-07 22:51:57	nosklo	I suggest you to really do the http REST requests on your code
2018-03-07 22:52:10	`7hr34t_hvntr	why's that, they can put results to separate files without risk of collision
2018-03-07 22:52:13	nosklo	that way you can do then using non-blocking code
2018-03-07 22:52:14	`7hr34t_hvntr	(the threads)
2018-03-07 22:52:21	monoprotic	`7hr34t_hvntr: can you use something like grequests https://github.com/kennethreitz/grequests
2018-03-07 22:52:28	nosklo	if one thread locks, you can't cancel it anymore
2018-03-07 22:52:29	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: did you check if they library you are using is thread safe?
2018-03-07 22:52:53	energizer	tbh processpoolexecutor would probably get the job done just fine, i know some people dont like it tho
2018-03-07 22:53:13	`7hr34t_hvntr	i didnt, i assume it wont know how the search is being called though
2018-03-07 22:53:19	nosklo	if you really don't want to write non-blocking code, I would go multiprocessing `7hr34t_hvntr
2018-03-07 22:53:20	`7hr34t_hvntr	we can have like 10 people searching at once
2018-03-07 22:53:23	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: if probably async or make a cli script I could pass jobs to.
2018-03-07 22:53:36	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: in the same copy of the lib? Don't assume it's thread safe
2018-03-07 22:53:38	sydbarret	I have this type of links  "<li><a href="career.html">Careers</a></li>" and also this type "  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/9254295/" target="_blank"><i aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a>". How can I grab them both types with beautifulsoup and also how can I diferentiate between the external links?
2018-03-07 22:55:51	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: you are literally doing just one type of request? A search? Shouldn't be hard to get the rest API figured out I'd think. Especially if it's internal and you have the lib
2018-03-07 22:56:50	`7hr34t_hvntr	that'd be a huge pain since im a novice
2018-03-07 22:57:02	`7hr34t_hvntr	wahts the benefit when i can do those requests manually
2018-03-07 22:57:17	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: you could just use treq with twisted
2018-03-07 22:57:53	`7hr34t_hvntr	i'll look into this
2018-03-07 22:58:01	`7hr34t_hvntr	would have to do some decent reverse engineering
2018-03-07 22:58:30	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: there's no docs for the actual rest API? And you can't contact the developer?
2018-03-07 22:58:54	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: I mean how much variation is there in your calls beyond the words in the search?
2018-03-07 22:59:45	`7hr34t_hvntr	not too much, it's just more stuff i'd have to learn. was trying to push something out fast
2018-03-07 23:00:19	`7hr34t_hvntr	this would be nice for later potentially. but as it stands this is just an optimization and not the end goal of the project
2018-03-07 23:00:30	`7hr34t_hvntr	i think i will hack together subprocess calls
2018-03-07 23:00:41	`7hr34t_hvntr	have them be mutually exclusive
2018-03-07 23:00:56	`7hr34t_hvntr	and print their results to the current window as well as to file
2018-03-07 23:01:38	`7hr34t_hvntr	then a single job will loop on those output puts and slowly append the contents to a list. or just concatenate them into a single file
2018-03-07 23:03:44	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: as I recall, non blocking reading of subprocess stdout is not trivial.  (Unless you use pyqt QProcess)
2018-03-07 23:07:39	`7hr34t_hvntr	 altendky okay, in that case i could launch all the subprocs and then once all are launched, loop over the result files and append them to a list to track what has been already processed
2018-03-07 23:07:54	`7hr34t_hvntr	and output new entries of the list to stdout
2018-03-07 23:08:05	`7hr34t_hvntr	basically a while loop
2018-03-07 23:08:17	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: you mean wait for them to complete and collect their output?
2018-03-07 23:08:35	`7hr34t_hvntr	windows would allow reading even when writing is occuring
2018-03-07 23:09:16	`7hr34t_hvntr	some sort of read only op
2018-03-07 23:09:19	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: is trailing trivial?
2018-03-07 23:09:26	altendky	Tailing...
2018-03-07 23:09:29	pjj	can anyone explain to me why result is assigned to None ? https://pastebin.com/20AfY7VK
2018-03-07 23:09:30	infobob	https://paste.pound-python.org/show/0O1chV9mrPya80wVNLuE/ (repasted for pjj)
2018-03-07 23:09:44	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: or, just have acceptable sized chunks to wait for the process to finish
2018-03-07 23:09:55	`7hr34t_hvntr	altendky, tailing would be the exact idea
2018-03-07 23:10:38	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: is it worth any amount of complexity?
2018-03-07 23:11:15	`7hr34t_hvntr	i'd like to give some sort of feedback to the user
2018-03-07 23:11:22	`7hr34t_hvntr	results would be ideal
2018-03-07 23:11:27	altendky	pjj: to make it be None if the exception isn't thrown. But at least for pytest there are better ways to make sure exceptions happen. Not sure for whatever framework that is using
2018-03-07 23:11:59	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: yes, but if you break up the 10k into chunks of 10 per process, is that not sufficient feedback frequency?
2018-03-07 23:12:09	altendky	Or 100, or...
2018-03-07 23:12:35	`7hr34t_hvntr	so of the 10k results, a filter is applied and perhaps only two will be returned to the user
2018-03-07 23:12:58	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: I'm not sure how that matters
2018-03-07 23:13:13	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: the result can't be delayed by 10 searches?
2018-03-07 23:13:21	altendky	It must be immediate?
2018-03-07 23:13:39	altendky	We're talking about seconds if that
2018-03-07 23:13:53	`7hr34t_hvntr	it could be delayed if it was required but the risk is the search taking 10 minutes and user getting no feedback
2018-03-07 23:13:59	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: and you said you were just having something functional together
2018-03-07 23:14:02	`7hr34t_hvntr	that's why i was using a generator objcet to spit out results
2018-03-07 23:14:08	`7hr34t_hvntr	as opposed to list
2018-03-07 23:14:31	pjj	altendky: oh thank you i see, they did it like that just for presentation purposes. This is ruby koans pythons tranlation.
2018-03-07 23:14:31	`7hr34t_hvntr	so i guess i didnt get your quesiton about chunks of 10 per process//acceptable sized schunks to wait for it to finish
2018-03-07 23:14:49	`7hr34t_hvntr	i guess you're saying, is there some number of chunks that will make it fast enough where trailing isnt needed
2018-03-07 23:14:55	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: that's fine, but having 10k moments where user might be updated in, say, 1 minute, vs 1k times seems not problematic. In fact, not noticeable
2018-03-07 23:15:05	altendky	Yes
2018-03-07 23:15:16	pjj	I could not figure out any logic behind it.
2018-03-07 23:15:24	pjj	Must be because I am learning? :D
2018-03-07 23:15:27	`7hr34t_hvntr	yeah
2018-03-07 23:15:52	energizer	pjj: where are you getting this from?
2018-03-07 23:16:05	`7hr34t_hvntr	i could skip the trailing altogether if the result was fast enough
2018-03-07 23:16:25	`7hr34t_hvntr	tailing
2018-03-07 23:16:30	pjj	energizer: https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans
2018-03-07 23:16:33	altendky	pjj: not for presentation, it is functionally relevant. Otherwise you get a name error rather than an assert in the case that the exception isn't raised
2018-03-07 23:18:00	energizer	pjj: this isn't the clearest way to write this
2018-03-07 23:18:19	pjj	I was completely thrown off by it.
2018-03-07 23:18:56	pjj	It just isn't how I have previously seen something like that done and was just curious if it was maybe because I think it is trying to directly port the ruby code into python and not necessarily pythonic
2018-03-07 23:19:36	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: right. So iirc you said you can now do 10k in right 10 minutes.  If we say it's 10x faster when you parallel it then 1 minute.  If we chunk it as 100 per process then we get 100 processes in that minute. So at 100 points in that minute you will get a chunk of 100 results to filter and hand to the user.
2018-03-07 23:20:13	⚡	Wulf4 is now known as Wulf
2018-03-07 23:20:13	`7hr34t_hvntr	agreed
2018-03-07 23:20:20	altendky	pjj: I wouldn't do that to assert an exception, but the form of defining a default value is perfectly normal
2018-03-07 23:20:54	pjj	Is there any specific reason for ever doing it or not doing it?
2018-03-07 23:20:56	energizer	i'd put it in an else
2018-03-07 23:21:34	pjj	* defining a default value in python that is.
2018-03-07 23:21:49	altendky	pjj: https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#unittest.TestCase.assertRaises
2018-03-07 23:22:32	altendky	pjj: when you have conditional thing you'll do to it. It's like an else clause but sometimes simpler and more clear
2018-03-07 23:22:34	energizer	the assertEqual stuff is weird
2018-03-07 23:23:03	altendky	pjj: it guarantees the thing is defined rather than having it be conditionally defined
2018-03-07 23:23:28	`7hr34t_hvntr	so we drop out the tailing. is the subprocess solution fine ?
2018-03-07 23:24:01	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: not my favorite, but...
2018-03-07 23:24:09	`7hr34t_hvntr	except it'd wait til the file is done being written to, then the writer would provide some signal, and reader would then read it in
2018-03-07 23:24:23	`7hr34t_hvntr	altendky, yes! that's what i like to hear. :)
2018-03-07 23:25:02	`7hr34t_hvntr	good old hackish solutions
2018-03-07 23:25:02	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: your subprocesses monitor would note that the process had terminated.  No 'signal' from the sub process other than being done
2018-03-07 23:25:32	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: or, you could learn a valuable coding tool...
2018-03-07 23:26:34	`7hr34t_hvntr	you mean reverse engineering the API and then using treq+twisted
2018-03-07 23:27:01	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: learning async and not freaking figuring out one request, yes
2018-03-07 23:27:14	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: but really, contact the author
2018-03-07 23:27:37	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: they may block you for doing this anyways
2018-03-07 23:27:39	`7hr34t_hvntr	there's a lot of things they can't get right
2018-03-07 23:27:53	`7hr34t_hvntr	that's why im doing it
2018-03-07 23:28:11	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: maybe, give them a chance to tell you the single request format
2018-03-07 23:28:19	energizer	pjj: i wouldnt define a default there. i'd use try-except-else, which would be clearer. also, lines 12-18 are not idiomatic imho.
2018-03-07 23:28:24	`7hr34t_hvntr	naw the server is not owned by them, just the software
2018-03-07 23:28:29	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: or just debug and step into their code
2018-03-07 23:28:53	`7hr34t_hvntr	yeah i can do that i jsut know the debugging will take a lot of time
2018-03-07 23:29:19	`7hr34t_hvntr	i will probably defer it until the final product is complete
2018-03-07 23:29:28	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: literally step until you find the line that sends the request
2018-03-07 23:29:55	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: yes, best to hack a thing and deal with that and then also do it right later... Much more efficient :|
2018-03-07 23:30:27	`7hr34t_hvntr	well, if treq is faster  it will matter
2018-03-07 23:30:35	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: it seems like you are basically just scared.  Step through their code for a bit.
2018-03-07 23:31:19	`7hr34t_hvntr	yes, the whole project has been a rabbit hole, im reading for a working product :P
2018-03-07 23:31:36	`7hr34t_hvntr	i will try this thing you're pushing
2018-03-07 23:31:41	`7hr34t_hvntr	figure out the request etc
2018-03-07 23:32:04	`7hr34t_hvntr	will have to add requests to the imports and so forth
2018-03-07 23:32:08	`7hr34t_hvntr	:(
2018-03-07 23:32:17	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: give it a chance. Especially asking. That's the really right way, even if it fails sometimes
2018-03-07 23:32:34	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: don't fear third party libs. Learn how to use them easily
2018-03-07 23:33:28	altendky	`7hr34t_hvntr: anyways, off to bed. Good luck
2018-03-07 23:33:30	`7hr34t_hvntr	alright thanks for the advicw
2018-03-07 23:33:48	`7hr34t_hvntr	same here
2018-03-07 23:33:50	`7hr34t_hvntr	ZzzZZ
2018-03-07 23:40:30	darkhanb	when pdb.set_trace() is used inside a method, how come "private" method names are mangled?
2018-03-07 23:40:59	_habnabit	darkhanb, what is it you're seeing?
2018-03-07 23:41:06	ssbr	darkhanb: "private" names are always mangled. What exactly do you mean?
2018-03-07 23:41:11	_habnabit	darkhanb, if by 'private' you mean __name it's what ssbr said
2018-03-07 23:41:41	darkhanb	is self._SomeClass__private_method the only way to access the "private" method?
2018-03-07 23:42:19	_habnabit	darkhanb, from pdb? yes. this is yet another reason to never bother with __name anyway, because it's not really 'private' and doesn't do anything useful
2018-03-07 23:42:55	ssbr	it does something extremely useful: it allows you to write undocumented methods in a base class that is designed to be inherited by classes outside of your control
2018-03-07 23:43:01	ssbr	of course, you shouldn't design base classes
2018-03-07 23:43:07	darkhanb	what I mean is I have no problem with this: object._SomeClass__private_method from outside the object, but when I stop the execution with pdb, if feels like, I'm not outside, and maybe I should be able to access __private_method directly
2018-03-07 23:43:13	ssbr	but if you do, __ is underrated
2018-03-07 23:43:23	ssbr	darkhanb: because pdb is executing in a scope that doesn't do name mangling automatically
2018-03-07 23:43:35	_habnabit	darkhanb, pdb could, sure, but nobody bothered because nobody uses __name
2018-03-07 23:44:07	ssbr	unfortunately.
2018-03-07 23:44:14	darkhanb	I see.
2018-03-07 23:44:32	_habnabit	ssbr, it's really not a good feature
2018-03-07 23:44:35	AlwaysHigh	anyone tell me why calendar.day_name[0] returns error "IndexError: list index out of range"
2018-03-07 23:44:38	ssbr	IMO any class designed for inheritance should use __ extensively and _ never.
2018-03-07 23:44:53	ssbr	_habnabit: I don't want to look up the list of all attributes the base class defines when I inherit from it
2018-03-07 23:44:58	_habnabit	AlwaysHigh, day_name is empty
2018-03-07 23:45:05	ssbr	_habnabit: why should I care that the base class defines 15 different attributes for managing its internal state?
2018-03-07 23:45:09	ssbr	_habnabit: they should hide it all.
2018-03-07 23:45:14	AlwaysHigh	but its not its set to 0
2018-03-07 23:45:15	_habnabit	ssbr, and that's why you don't inherit from classes
2018-03-07 23:45:23	ssbr	_habnabit: too bad, Twisted was designed for inheritance
2018-03-07 23:45:27	_habnabit	AlwaysHigh, what's set to 0
2018-03-07 23:45:33	ssbr	_habnabit: any library that does this should be using __, not _.
2018-03-07 23:45:35	AlwaysHigh	day_name
2018-03-07 23:45:45	ssbr	_habnabit: but you're right, maybe we should all switch to asyncio
2018-03-07 23:45:53	_habnabit	AlwaysHigh, 0[0] isn't going to give you an IndexError
2018-03-07 23:46:19	_habnabit	ssbr, you're a jerk
2018-03-07 23:46:21	AlwaysHigh	_habnabit, it does though its suppose to return the day name
2018-03-07 23:46:30	ssbr	_habnabit: but you know im right
2018-03-07 23:46:34	_habnabit	ssbr, no
2018-03-07 23:46:42	_habnabit	AlwaysHigh, http://sscce.org/
2018-03-07 23:46:59	ssbr	_habnabit: I don't have an alternate solution here. Either don't design for inheritance, or do design for inheritance but use __ extensively to hide internal attributes.
2018-03-07 23:47:17	ssbr	_habnabit: where is the room in the world for "inheritance, but don't use __"?
2018-03-07 23:47:37	ssbr	for existing software that uses inheritance, it should be moved to use __ where possible.
2018-03-07 23:47:40	_habnabit	ssbr, designing for inheritance is a mistake
2018-03-07 23:47:52	ssbr	_habnabit: uncorrectable without breaking backwards compatibility, so we live with the world we have.
2018-03-07 23:48:21	ssbr	_habnabit: should Twisted not use __? Have you ever spent half an hour debugging weird type errors because you accidentally stomped on the private variables of a Twisted base class? I have. It was awful.
2018-03-07 23:48:35	ssbr	Twisted, and all other software that uses inheritance, should use __ to prevent that.
2018-03-07 23:48:40	runciter	we shouldn't because we have proxyForInterface
2018-03-07 23:49:31	ssbr	if you simultaneously say "don't use inheritance, and don't use __", it's my belief that people that like inheritance will still listen to the second bit of advice, and this will produce worse software.
2018-03-07 23:49:41	darkhanb	So is the common practice just do _private_method (one underscore), which has no name mangling, but it sort of says, don't program against it as it was meant to be private?
2018-03-07 23:49:44	ssbr	the right advice is "__ is only for code that uses inheritance, and you shouldn't use inheritance"
2018-03-07 23:49:53	ssbr	which is _totally_ different from calling it "useless", which it is not.
2018-03-07 23:50:20	runciter	except the rules around __'s name mangling are weird
2018-03-07 23:50:39	ssbr	not that weird. it's predictable once you get used to it.
2018-03-07 23:51:18	runciter	what private variables did you stomp on?
2018-03-07 23:51:42	_habnabit	ssbr, it creates a lot of extra work, like what we're talking about now, and other things like getattr for dispatch. also the mangled bit is simple lexical replacement and you can have problems if you also have colliding class names
