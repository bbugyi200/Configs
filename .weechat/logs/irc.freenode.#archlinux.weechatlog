2018-03-03 20:14:40	PhazonicRidley	please tell me
2018-03-03 20:14:42	itsnameless	Tk is the de-facto Python standard GUI
2018-03-03 20:14:49	itsnameless	you did import tkinter like this:
2018-03-03 20:14:53	coderobe	PhazonicRidley: take a look at your code again
2018-03-03 20:14:58	itsnameless	import tkinter

2018-03-03 20:15:14	PhazonicRidley	it worked on windows /shrug

2018-03-03 20:15:28	PhazonicRidley	no thats the error
2018-03-03 20:15:39	PhazonicRidley	its import turtle iirc
2018-03-03 20:15:46	achillion	I mean are you trying to run your code or someone elses?
2018-03-03 20:15:51	occultus	PhazonicRidley: turtle tried to import tkinter, and it found something called "tkinter" -- that you made, that's not the "real" tkinter
2018-03-03 20:15:52	resixian	gist that whole module
2018-03-03 20:15:58	resixian	and maybe got to #python for hep

2018-03-03 20:16:01	--	piie is now known as piiE
2018-03-03 20:16:02	coderobe	you're importing tkinter as "TK", and try to access it as "Tk()"
2018-03-03 20:16:03	coderobe	jeez
2018-03-03 20:16:06	achillion	PhazonicRidley: tkinter is there. it gets imported as TK (both caps). Then it tries to run as Tk (lowercase k)
2018-03-03 20:16:11	itsnameless	Tkinter = for versions prior to v3.0
2018-03-03 20:16:26	itsnameless	tkinter = for versions v3.0 and later
2018-03-03 20:16:27	occultus	apparently nobody read the stack trace
2018-03-03 20:16:33	PhazonicRidley	ok is there a quick way to check the tkinter is installed?
2018-03-03 20:16:45	occultus	PhazonicRidley: your file called tkinter.py is confusing python
2018-03-03 20:16:47	PhazonicRidley	i can worry about my code later
2018-03-03 20:16:56	PhazonicRidley	uh ok
2018-03-03 20:16:57	itsnameless	Yes, you can try if it's installed.
2018-03-03 20:17:02	coderobe	occultus: oh wow
2018-03-03 20:17:08	itsnameless	You're using Python 3.6 or Python 2.7?
2018-03-03 20:17:10	coderobe	that shouldn't be the default behavior though
2018-03-03 20:17:12	achillion	occultus: right, that's the other issue, but the immediate one is the cap issue. good eye

2018-03-03 20:17:24	occultus	achillion: it's not a caps issue
2018-03-03 20:17:34	achillion	occultus: the immediate issue is
2018-03-03 20:17:38	PhazonicRidley	like i said, the thing runs on windows
2018-03-03 20:17:38	occultus	achillion: turtle can import it as TK if it wants
2018-03-03 20:17:42	itsnameless	Then write this:
2018-03-03 20:17:49	itsnameless	import tkinter
2018-03-03 20:18:00	achillion	occultus: yes it can, but then it errors on Tk()
2018-03-03 20:18:02	itsnameless	tkinter._test()
2018-03-03 20:18:04	occultus	achillion: the immediate issue is that turtle imported "tkinter" and got "some custom tkinter.py"
2018-03-03 20:18:12	itsnameless	import tkinter
2018-03-03 20:18:13	itsnameless	tkinter._test()

2018-03-04 00:19:08	Mart|n	what have you done so far vypr
2018-03-04 00:19:10	r0n0x	to correct that ridiculous hypothetical, using windows on a portable device* 
2018-03-04 00:19:24	r0n0x	and, if i dont use this tablet, i will also die for no reason whatsoever
2018-03-04 00:19:37	vypr	At first I thought it was an issue with graphics acceleration, so I added `Option "NoAccel" "True"` to my 20-intel.conf.
2018-03-04 00:19:42	vypr	But besides that, that's it.
2018-03-04 00:19:43	raster	r0n0x: then ... time to have fun and mess a lot with efi :)
2018-03-04 00:19:54	Mart|n	have u install video drivers
2018-03-04 00:19:55	vypr	I can't find a solution that's applicable to my problem, because most people reporting this are using GDM or what have you.

2018-03-04 00:27:38	raster	i made it boot of an sd card from a usb sd card reader plugged in and i had to create a fat boot partition with the right 32bit efi thing in the right dir

2018-03-04 01:36:02	raster	(also if they dont stay up to date on releases .... looking at you arch recently... :))

2018-03-04 01:37:03	guys	CountryfiedLinux: I notice this is not the Elementary channel either
2018-03-04 01:37:29	raster	guys:  gah. pam. urgh. we've had to do some hackery to mke our pam auth support work by pretending to be other commonly known auth clients :)
2018-03-04 01:37:35	raster	but it ends up working
2018-03-04 01:37:40	guys	I know it must be difficult to tell as #archlinux looks quite similar to #elementary

2018-03-04 01:40:43	raster	:)
2018-03-04 01:40:47	guys	but all cinnamon needs to do is test if the "change login password" dialog has a correct password, which is dead simple in theory
2018-03-04 01:41:02	guys	so all you need is passwd checks
2018-03-04 01:41:05	raster	like 15 years of making sure screen unlock works on linux is buried in that code

'jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj'). The problem occurs in X and without X.

2018-03-04 04:48:31	Waples_	works before suspend; after I open the lid, I have to press the power button to resume (dunno why either), and then the keyboard doesnt work. Funny thing is, that the keyboard backlight lights up after a button press (and stays on, as if it's always pressed).
2018-03-04 04:49:42	RetardedOnion	it looks like your keyboard is connected via ps2. the i8042 controller. makes sense. look at https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/admin-guide/kernel-parameters.txt for the "i8042." options. dont forget to grub-mkconfig. nomux or reset could help....

2018-03-04 05:30:22	Tazmain	I love seeing this while I boot  Intel Spectre v2 broken microcode detected; disabling Speculation Control 
2018-03-04 05:31:00	deltasquared	Tazmain: actually I think that would probably make me a tad irate
2018-03-04 05:31:12	RetardedOnion	Why would you boot UEFI? 
2018-03-04 05:31:31	Tazmain	deltasquared, well it's gonna be like that for a while. 
2018-03-04 05:31:36	Namarrgon	Ingar: somewhere in /sys/firmware/efi/efivars is systemd-boot's timeout value, which you probably set to 0 by accident
2018-03-04 05:32:25	Ingar	space doesnt work 
2018-03-04 05:32:27	Waples_	RetardedOnion: hmmn weird; internal keyboard has started working again
2018-03-04 05:32:52	tuerai	occasionally my desktop almost completely hangs and steam crashes. does that sound like it could be running out of memory/swap ?
2018-03-04 05:32:54	Ingar	Namarrgon: well, actually, I didnt do anything. It suddenly stopped working
2018-03-04 05:33:15	RetardedOnion	@Waples_ then have fun
2018-03-04 05:33:18	Ingar	efibootmgr says timeout is 1, loader.conf has timeout 5 for the menu
2018-03-04 05:33:26	honestly	I updated and rebooted and now my touchpad is "jittery" - it's actually hard to use tap-to-click because the mouse pointer keeps moving around. There was no noticeable pointer jitter before. The speed of the mouse pointer is not different. Did something in the defaults for libinput change?
2018-03-04 05:33:44	Namarrgon	Ingar: efibootmgr doesn't read systemd-boot's config and loader.conf is overriden by the efivar values
2018-03-04 05:33:51	Waples_	RetardedOnion: yeah,, dunno, probably when I close the lid again, it stops :p

2018-03-04 08:28:39	bored_gourd	archer121_: Defining colors in ~/.config/termite/config usually fixes this for me, with the addition of matching the terminal theme 
2018-03-04 08:28:39	grawity	distinguished.vim seems to be a 256-color scheme, so as long as your $TERM is "something-256color", then it should still work fine

2018-03-04 09:54:54	earnestly	guys: I don't blame the people really, that's never a good solution.  I'm more critical of software not being didactic enough.  I compare it to using C compilers in the 90s when you got no real warnings or suggestions, let alone errors

2018-03-04 09:56:54	guys	beest: I never used alad's broken stuff, I preferred discussing its development with him while using my own shell script from a safe distance.

2018-03-04 10:43:55	gregbert	i am in switzerland... but the computer in question is in the US. i managed to muck up the openssl installation (did the aboslutely boneheaded thing of Sy'ing openssl and not the whole system)... i recoverd the libraries (libcrypt, etc).. so i screwed up. reading for roasting.. but i do have webmin..

2018-03-04 11:49:32	guys	well, uh, don't do that?
2018-03-04 11:49:40	Scimmia	yes to which?
2018-03-04 11:49:41	guys	But anatolik's key appears to be broken as well
2018-03-04 11:49:52	hvsr	resixian: are you using an old ISO?
2018-03-04 11:50:09	resixian	as above, this is a box that hasn't been turned on since june 2017
2018-03-04 11:50:35	resixian	i was thinkign of trying to upgrade just pacman-keyring next. 
2018-03-04 11:50:56	Scimmia	resixian: if there were no errors and the keyring package is even somewhat up to date, you shouldn't be having the error from Eli's key
2018-03-04 11:51:13	guys	Scimmia: the first paste indicated that pacman-key --refresh-keys was successful
2018-03-04 11:51:16	resixian	maybe there is an error and i'm too stupid to realize it
2018-03-04 11:51:28	guys	So it would likely be an issue with the master keys
2018-03-04 11:51:28	Scimmia	guys: has nothing to do with the master keys getting signed

2018-03-04 12:09:01	resixian	and 100 is bigger than 92, so it must be better. right? ;)
2018-03-04 12:09:06	guys	hmm, looks like Scimmia accidentally told you it was okay to just update pacman-key, when that really should have referred to "update archlinux-keyring"

2018-03-04 12:23:25	earnestly	metastable: It's funny
2018-03-04 12:23:32	BrainDamage	replacing ffmpeg's package with its fork
2018-03-04 12:24:09	earnestly	metastable: mpv used to produce a warning about mismatched library versions because, for whatever reason, Debian would link mpv against one version of ffmepg and then use a different one
2018-03-04 12:24:23	beest	tl;dr ffmpeg got forked, debian started shipping the fork, the dumbs ensued, debian switched back, the fork is largely dead now? i dunno what's up with libav these days
2018-03-04 12:24:44	metastable	Debian, amirite?
2018-03-04 12:24:45	earnestly	metastable: Debian, obviously patched out these warnings so mpv was getting issues from debian users about subtle bugs due to this
2018-03-04 12:24:58	earnestly	metastable: So mpv made it a fatal error if there was a mismatch... which debian patched out
2018-03-04 12:24:59	BrainDamage	you're talking about 2 diff dramas, both equally funny
2018-03-04 12:25:05	beest	earnestly elucidated "the dumbs" nicely there for me :D
2018-03-04 12:25:13	earnestly	Oh yeah, there's plenty of fun dramas with mpv
2018-03-04 12:25:31	▷	metastable is stealing "the dumbs" as a generic phrase, now.
2018-03-04 12:25:50	earnestly	metastable: It's from an early internet meme, "Today I have the dumb"

2018-03-04 12:30:16	beest	hmm certainly looks that way
2018-03-04 12:30:19	earnestly	It really does make me think that maybe libav was right
2018-03-04 12:30:30	Scimmia	libav is essentially dead, though, there's no future when nobody will adopt it
2018-03-04 12:30:54	earnestly	Yeah I'm not entirely sure why people seem to work on it, but ffmpeg is still absorbing everything it does
2018-03-04 12:31:07	throstur	0ad is only at version a22-4 in pacman, can I force it to use a newer version somehow or do I have to PKGBUILD it myself for that?
2018-03-04 12:31:21	beest	there are a not-insignificant number of forks that were both right and impossible to shift adoption to

2018-03-04 12:31:52	beest	throstur: the latter, which is also forcing it to use a newer version somehow so you're correct on both counts!
2018-03-04 12:32:01	guys	throstur: why do you want a newer version, the package is not flagged out of date
2018-03-04 12:32:07	earnestly	I should figure out how much of ffmpeg is actually not libav backporting
2018-03-04 12:32:11	throstur	guys: I want to use a mod that requires the newer version
2018-03-04 12:32:19	throstur	guys: and maybe the package should be flagged out of date?
2018-03-04 12:32:39	guys	what newer version and why don't you flag it out of date instead to fix for everyone instead of just you...
2018-03-04 12:32:59	earnestly	But certainly, Niedermayer really does make you think libav was proberly the right thing to do
2018-03-04 12:33:12	beest	throstur: alpha-22 is the latest release
2018-03-04 12:33:22	throstur	oh, okay then
2018-03-04 12:33:23	Scimmia	throstur: what newer version? That's still the latest listed on their site
2018-03-04 12:33:31	throstur	Scimmia: I was just going by the github repository
2018-03-04 12:33:39	beest	throstur: if you want a recent revision there's probably a vcs package in the aur

2018-03-04 12:33:56	earnestly	This old news
2018-03-04 12:34:06	earnestly	Seems so damn accurate after reading mailing lists involving that person
2018-03-04 12:34:46	Scimmia	earnestly: does it really matter, though
2018-03-04 12:35:06	earnestly	Scimmia: Nope, clearly ffmpeg is still the main library used
2018-03-04 12:35:17	earnestly	And they still get everything libav does, so yeah
2018-03-04 12:35:38	Scimmia	even Debian swtiched back, and the maintainer there was one of the people involved in the fork
2018-03-04 12:35:49	Scimmia	which is the only reason they swithed in the first place
2018-03-04 12:37:01	earnestly	Yeah, all I can say is I have more sympathy for it
2018-03-04 12:37:56	earnestly	But ffmpeg gets more attention, even with things like Google's OSSFuzz initiative so has fixes sooner
2018-03-04 12:39:55	ilmostro	inefficient
2018-03-04 12:41:10	guys	ilmostro: what, you?
2018-03-04 12:41:44	throstur	0ad-git and 0ad-data-git have a cyclical dependency... I'm guessing now would be a correct time to flag "0ad-git" out of date?

2018-03-04 12:42:27	ilmostro	:) definitely; also, just going based on the discussion here, the frustration by the project leader is understandable, albeit perhaps over-the-top
2018-03-04 12:44:40	guys	ilmostro: the problem with ffmpeg is that both sides are a flaming pile of poo
2018-03-04 12:50:11	earnestly	Well no
2018-03-04 12:50:42	earnestly	In an ideal world, we'd be using libav
2018-03-04 12:51:54	earnestly	It's a bit like the openssl story

2018-03-04 13:05:24	guys	I could accept that.
2018-03-04 13:05:25	earnestly	I agree

2018-03-04 13:06:42	Hell-Razor	RetardedOnion, I think it does too but as I read the wiki--- do you really need two sets of kb and mouse?
2018-03-04 13:07:23	warmth	is there any 101 alsa tutorial how to get this shit working properly? 
2018-03-04 13:07:34	RetardedOnion	Hell-Razor: no. you can use qxl to set up and later set up synergy
2018-03-04 13:07:52	Hell-Razor	Doesnt synergy have latency issues though? I just want to do this to play some games
2018-03-04 13:08:09	RetardedOnion	around 1 frame
2018-03-04 13:08:30	Hell-Razor	So there is lag
2018-03-04 13:08:33	RetardedOnion	be sure to use virtio for network/ssd whatever
2018-03-04 13:08:44	RetardedOnion	1 frame. its not that much
2018-03-04 13:09:07	RetardedOnion	do you play csgo at events? then dont.

2018-03-04 13:10:05	RetardedOnion	1/60 of a second is not that bad
2018-03-04 13:10:26	RetardedOnion	you can pass the usb devices through and use linux as your synergy client
2018-03-04 13:10:52	RetardedOnion	if you really care, which you should not since you dont get 100% performance anyway. 
2018-03-04 13:11:09	Hell-Razor	Then dont I need windows running the entire time
2018-03-04 13:11:36	RetardedOnion	you dont need to isolate your usb devices
2018-03-04 13:11:49	Hell-Razor	I swore there was / is a way to hand off devicesor like tab and have them switch but I guess I am losing it

2018-03-04 13:12:12	Hell-Razor	I mean ditching it as my main os

2018-03-04 14:49:38	Manson	but only on KDE
2018-03-04 14:50:16	teraflops	?pkgfile rc.local
2018-03-04 14:50:17	Manson	Gnome seems to use another way to authenticate/validate its users
2018-03-04 14:50:17	@EMIYA	teraflops: no results for 'rc.local'
2018-03-04 14:50:49	guys	Manson: are you running a 2011 version of Arch Linux
2018-03-04 14:50:53	mfrinnstrom	I'm going to reinstall Arch after some time with other distros. I'm thinking of going with systemd-boot instead of grub to see how that goes? Anything I should be aware about regarding that? I also want to try btrfs together with LUKS, are there any recommendations for that or should I just follow the guide in the wiki?
2018-03-04 14:50:58	Manson	no guys
2018-03-04 14:51:03	Manson	the lastest
2018-03-04 14:51:08	teraflops	he's running debiarch
2018-03-04 14:51:19	guys	Manson: I dispute that, there is no such thing as rc.local on Arch
2018-03-04 14:51:34	MacGyver	mfrinnstrom: Not really; it's all on the wiki.
2018-03-04 14:51:34	guys	Therefore, since you claim to be using Arch, you must be using the version of Arch from 2011
2018-03-04 14:51:35	Manson	oh there is
2018-03-04 14:51:38	Manson	you have to make it
2018-03-04 14:51:53	guys	Manson: I can create a file like that, but it won't do anything...
2018-03-04 14:51:54	teraflops	Manson: you can make it ofc but it wont work :P
2018-03-04 14:52:00	guys	`touch /etc/giggity`
2018-03-04 14:52:04	guys	see, does nothing

2018-03-04 14:52:08	Manson	the easy way
2018-03-04 14:52:22	Manson	you need to create a service
2018-03-04 14:52:24	Manson	and so on
2018-03-04 14:52:28	mfrinnstrom	MacGyver: Great, thanks
2018-03-04 14:52:29	Manson	but not always works
2018-03-04 14:52:44	teraflops	Manson: stop running such crap
2018-03-04 14:52:48	MacGyver	mfrinnstrom: Only thing you really need to be aware of is that the kernel needs to live on the ESP.
2018-03-04 14:53:01	MacGyver	mfrinnstrom: Easiest thing to do is to just mount the ESP as /boot.
2018-03-04 14:53:45	guys	mfrinnstrom: yep, systemd-boot, unlike grub and refind, does not support ext4/btrfs filesystems for the kernel/initramfs
2018-03-04 14:53:52	Manson	Kernel: x86_64 Linux 4.15.3-2-ARCH
2018-03-04 14:54:05	MacGyver	guys: That's... not because they're ext4 or btrfs.
2018-03-04 14:54:17	mfrinnstrom	MacGyver: Yeah, that's what I have managed to understand as well. I'm not sure about the effects on security though
2018-03-04 14:54:28	guys	MacGyver: that's because they're not fat32
2018-03-04 14:55:14	guys	mfrinnstrom: unless you have a compelling urge for an encrypted /boot and keeping your esp on a flashdrive in your pocket, the differences really have nothing to do with security
2018-03-04 14:55:27	grawity	well, I suppose you could use https://github.com/pbatard/efifs

2018-03-04 14:56:36	mfrinnstrom	guys: Not really, tried that once just to try it. Not that much fun though
2018-03-04 14:56:40	MacGyver	For some reason I remember that this had nothing to do with the FS-type directly, but rather simply that it uses EFISTUB-loading which can only happen from the ESP.
2018-03-04 14:56:45	guys	grawity: interesting
2018-03-04 14:56:52	MacGyver	Now I'm not entirely sure about that anymore.

2018-03-04 15:20:08	post-factum	iirc, libvirt locally works through unix socket, so no, it shouldn't block it
2018-03-04 15:20:33	gargantua	i checked the permissions for those sockets too
2018-03-04 15:20:42	gargantua	somewhere in /var, it was correct

2018-03-04 16:22:46	gunix	usr13: what script is incomplete?
2018-03-04 16:23:09	Raku	PhazonicRidley, Just do it manually
2018-03-04 16:23:11	usr13	"sshuttle"
2018-03-04 16:23:20	mSSM	My system didn't recognize my usb flash disk when booting, so I booted the USB in bios mode. If I read the wiki correctly, I cannot/shouldn't try and configure grub or systemd-boot when booted this way. Can I still make my system boot in uefi mode?
2018-03-04 16:23:34	earnestly	guys: Yeah but what do you do?  Should we do full code analysis of these terrible codebases to point out every single flaw with them?  There seems to be a new one popping up rapidly these days so it seems like a waste of time
2018-03-04 16:23:37	Raku	PhazonicRidley, Shoot me a PM I'll help you out
2018-03-04 16:23:37	mSSM	Also, any ideas why my system didn't recognize the usb flash as uefi bootable?
2018-03-04 16:23:41	PhazonicRidley	er um the download links said ubuntu/debian only
2018-03-04 16:23:49	gunix	usr13: sshuttle is not my script. it's a package. do "pacman -Ss sshuttle". i installed it to try it out, since i use it a lot on other distros, but on arch it fails even on localhost
2018-03-04 16:23:56	grawity	mSSM: you can install an uefi bootloader 95%
2018-03-04 16:23:59	PhazonicRidley	hang on im trying pacaur again
2018-03-04 16:24:09	guys	earnestly: I guess I could write an AUR helper that is so popular no one uses the bad ones?
2018-03-04 16:24:22	PhazonicRidley	if this fails ill take u up on that, raku
2018-03-04 16:24:35	grawity	mSSM: that is, you cannot add new UEFI boot entries, but you can still do the rest, and you can copy the bootloader to \efi\boot\bootx64.efi
2018-03-04 16:24:36	earnestly	guys: That's kind of the only solution
2018-03-04 16:24:46	guys	Although, trizen has always been around.

2018-03-04 16:25:32	guys	I've unfortunately heard the claim that trizen is more secure because it uses perl
2018-03-04 16:25:40	akela	what AUR helpers do you consider as good ones?
2018-03-04 16:25:52	Raku	PhazonicRidley, Looks like your mirrors out of date
2018-03-04 16:26:01	Raku	Do a `pacman -Syu`
2018-03-04 16:26:07	PhazonicRidley	alright
2018-03-04 16:26:08	coderobe	... more like the local repo, not the mirror
2018-03-04 16:26:10	guys	also because the author is "mathematically correct" (when implementing bad features)
2018-03-04 16:26:20	guys	akela: aurutils is good
2018-03-04 16:26:35	akela	I'm using cower right now
2018-03-04 16:26:36	Raku	guys, What do you think of yay
2018-03-04 16:26:43	guys	aurman looks like it is improved dramatically from initial attempts
2018-03-04 16:27:21	maksim_	hey guys, can someone tell me how to set a default dns for all interfaces. I tried to modify /etc/dhcpd.conf like described in the arch wiki, but apparently I done something wrong...
2018-03-04 16:27:21	guys	Raku: I sort of dislike the fact that yay reimplements quite a bit of error handling and transactional picking
2018-03-04 16:27:25	earnestly	akela: Why are you using cower?
2018-03-04 16:27:30	PhazonicRidley	how often is it recommended to do an -Syu?
2018-03-04 16:27:32	guys	But I cannot point to anything obviously wrong
2018-03-04 16:27:50	Raku	PhazonicRidley, Basically every time you're installing something
2018-03-04 16:27:53	lo1	always check for what get updated before blindly installing lots of aur update
2018-03-04 16:28:00	PhazonicRidley	alright good to know
2018-03-04 16:28:05	Lartza_	Or just, all the time really
2018-03-04 16:28:06	RetardedOnion	PhazonicRidley: there is no problem with doing pacman -Syu
2018-03-04 16:28:08	Raku	PhazonicRidley, What command did you run to install teamviewer
2018-03-04 16:28:18	Raku	Ya, just do `pacman -Syu <package name>`
2018-03-04 16:28:22	akela	earnestly: because it seems to do what I was looking for
2018-03-04 16:28:25	PhazonicRidley	np with -Syu
2018-03-04 16:28:31	PhazonicRidley	just downloading stuff
2018-03-04 16:28:41	Lartza_	lo1, pacman has nothing to do with AUR updates
2018-03-04 16:28:49	PhazonicRidley	cmd i used was pacaur -S teamviewer
2018-03-04 16:28:49	earnestly	akela: Look into auracle, it's a replacement written by the same author who gave up on cower due to systemantic problems with the design.  The README explains more
2018-03-04 16:28:54	guys	Raku: yay does a whole song and a dance with pacman -R and pacman -U to try to save the user from having to press Y at a package conflict
2018-03-04 16:29:06	akela	earnestly: meaning I only want it to check for AUR updates, the other stuff I like to do it manually
2018-03-04 16:29:11	Raku	Ya it has some problems with that
2018-03-04 16:29:13	guys	I also had to shame them too, into offering an off switch for their sudo loop
2018-03-04 16:29:18	akela	earnestly: thanks, I'll check now
2018-03-04 16:29:19	coderobe	Lartza_: if you build the packages on the same system then yes, it does. updating dependencies before building aur packages linking against said dependencies is a thing you should do either way
2018-03-04 16:29:29	alexas	I have a .mkv film 4,7 GB I wish to burn to dvd to be played on dvd-player (means converting to dvd compatible format) anybody here can recommend which utilities to be used for that? 
2018-03-04 16:29:32	PhazonicRidley	the screenshot above showed my errors
2018-03-04 16:29:42	Raku	I know that annoyed me, when an aur package builds then fails due to a conflict and didn't let me try and resolve it
2018-03-04 16:29:45	PhazonicRidley	for pacaur -S teamviewer
2018-03-04 16:29:47	Lartza_	coderobe, -Syu will do nothing to your AUR packages wherever they are
2018-03-04 16:29:55	lo1	Lartza_ i'm not keeping up with the pace, i was answering to akela
2018-03-04 16:29:56	guys	coderobe: or use aurutils and build aur packages first... in a chroot :D
2018-03-04 16:30:05	coderobe	Lartza_: -Syu, before building aur packages on the same system, will affect the packages you build afterwards.
2018-03-04 16:30:23	maksim_	does somebody tried dnscrypt?
2018-03-04 16:30:25	Raku	PhazonicRidley, It's still giving the same error?

2018-03-04 16:30:39	Lartza_	coderobe, I mean... yes? If there are dependencies. That wasn't the point that was made

2018-03-04 16:32:09	gunix	usr13: i don't have enough dev skill to debug the application and fix the error in the sourcecode
2018-03-04 16:32:22	andreyv	Is there any difference between the -enable-kvm and -machine type=pc,accel=kvm QEMU options?
2018-03-04 16:32:23	PhazonicRidley	so far so good
2018-03-04 16:32:34	gunix	usr13: i was hoping somebody knows a quick hack so this can be used and maybe added to archwiki
2018-03-04 16:32:54	gunix	usr13: if there is something wrong with the source code, i would rather report it to the devs (if this is not realted to archlinux packaging)
2018-03-04 16:33:12	PhazonicRidley	works
2018-03-04 16:33:32	coderobe	gunix, usr13: sshuttle works fine. not sure what you're talking about

2018-03-04 16:37:36	PhazonicRidley	ok srry had to reboot
2018-03-04 16:37:55	PhazonicRidley	was having a gui issue

2018-03-04 16:38:03	PhazonicRidley	but fixed now

2018-03-04 16:40:23	Raku	And then once it's enabled it should start every other reboot

2018-03-04 16:47:20	PhazonicRidley	also, is there a good systemwide spell checker?
2018-03-04 16:48:02	Raku	PhazonicRidley, Depends on what you mean by systemwide
2018-03-04 16:48:08	MarcinWieczorek	PhazonicRidley: hunspell aspell
2018-03-04 16:48:24	PhazonicRidley	i mean doesnt matter what app im using, ill have spellcheck
2018-03-04 16:48:27	PhazonicRidley	ok
2018-03-04 16:48:39	MarcinWieczorek	"If the app supports it"
2018-03-04 16:48:40	Raku	Well, it depends on the app
2018-03-04 16:48:47	PhazonicRidley	thats true
2018-03-04 16:48:55	PhazonicRidley	i assume most apps tho
2018-03-04 16:49:01	Raku	There's nothing you can do that's truly systemwide, cause a lot of them will override it
2018-03-04 16:49:01	PhazonicRidley	the more the better
2018-03-04 16:49:01	MarcinWieczorek	Most apps use those two if any
2018-03-04 16:49:15	Raku	Or they'll have their own thing
2018-03-04 16:49:25	PhazonicRidley	im just mad discord has spellcheck on windows but not linux
2018-03-04 16:49:28	PhazonicRidley	ANGERY
2018-03-04 16:49:37	Raku	That's odd it doesn't
2018-03-04 16:49:40	Raku	It should
2018-03-04 16:49:51	akela	MarcinWieczorek: it's a Pentium(R) Dual-Core  CPU      E5400  @ 2.70GHz. will, for example, change the CFLAGS from -mtune=generic to -mtune=native make such a difference?
2018-03-04 16:49:54	Raku	Discord is just using electron, so since chrome has a spellchecker it shouldn't matter the platform
2018-03-04 16:50:07	PhazonicRidley	well, it doesnt have spellcheck
2018-03-04 16:50:33	PhazonicRidley	maybe i should try   sudo pacman -Syu discord

2018-03-04 16:54:53	guys	akela: -march=native will often grant you minor improvements, it's not worth recompiling everything but you might as well if you don't plan to use it on other hardware
2018-03-04 16:55:31	guys	that's some pretty old hardware though
2018-03-04 16:55:40	maksim_	MarcinWieczorek: did not worked as accepted

2018-03-04 16:56:54	lo1	makksim_ what changes did you make?
2018-03-04 16:56:55	mpan	akela: don’t expect that some optimization options to gcc will make anything magically run faster. Quite often you may get opposite effect. -march and -mtune are quite safe in that manner (they should not cause slowdown), but other options may make things worse.
2018-03-04 16:57:17	Raku	ccache will help some
2018-03-04 16:57:20	guys	akela: no problem, I have a dell vostro 1500 (core2 duo) that only recently went out of use due to a cracked screen
2018-03-04 16:57:23	Raku	If you're building arch packages
2018-03-04 16:57:24	akela	guys: It takes a long time to compile gcc and stuff like that.. but still better than compiling it with homebrew on a mac.. my god
2018-03-04 16:57:52	akela	mpan: thanks , maybe I won't touch anything then, just grab a cup of tea and wait
2018-03-04 16:58:19	guys	yeah, I generally left that on overnight
2018-03-04 16:59:02	guys	anyway, like I said, -march=native is quite safe and will usually help a little (just not enough to justify compiling @world gentoo-style) 
2018-03-04 16:59:34	ferr__	Hey, I only see dummy device in pulseaudio, and the tip to kill the process does not help, any advices?
2018-03-04 16:59:42	guys	the issue comes when trying to pick your own optimizations without knowing what you are doing (as -march=native is quite clever about that and humans are less so)
2018-03-04 17:02:00	akela	guys: yes, I'm not that experienced so I'll leave =native and try

2018-03-04 17:25:15	ferr__	MrElendig: would downgrading linux help?
2018-03-04 17:25:41	MrElendig	unlikely
2018-03-04 17:26:00	MrElendig	resetting the firmware might help

2018-03-04 17:28:59	maksim_	hey why does nm don't accept the dns configuration of dhcpd.conf?
2018-03-04 17:29:12	flacks	MrElendig, ferr__ I'd think downgrading linux is a good idea. resetting firmware is typically very non-trivial, and a kernel config/source discrepancy is much more likely
2018-03-04 17:29:33	flacks	..to be the culprit
2018-03-04 17:29:56	Scimmia	maksim_: you're using nm to run a dhcp server?
2018-03-04 17:30:13	MrElendig	it is usually some state file or buggy af firmware when audio breaks like that on suspend
2018-03-04 17:30:46	maksim_	nope i'm trying to set a default dns in dhcpd.conf for all my interfaces
2018-03-04 17:31:02	Scimmia	maksim_: dhcpd is a dns server, not a client
2018-03-04 17:31:11	Scimmia	er, dhcp
2018-03-04 17:31:19	MrElendig	and has nothing to do with networkmanager
2018-03-04 17:31:28	MrElendig	just set the dns in the nm profile
2018-03-04 17:31:36	maksim_	i'm sry dhcpcd.conf ;)
2018-03-04 17:31:42	flacks	MrElendig, oh, I see. and ferr__ left. hm
2018-03-04 17:31:50	Scimmia	maksim_: well then it's because nm doesn't use dhcpcd at all
2018-03-04 17:32:41	Lartza_	Infact they conflict and shouldn't be used together
2018-03-04 17:32:48	Lartza_	Set your DNS in NM
2018-03-04 17:33:02	maksim_	Scimmia: what does it use than?

2018-03-04 17:34:03	MrElendig	umh
2018-03-04 17:34:08	MrElendig	what was the command you ran?
2018-03-04 17:34:12	BoBeR182	nothing
2018-03-04 17:34:17	BoBeR182	I mean it happened on it's own
2018-03-04 17:34:34	BoBeR182	when i click to mount it in nautalius it gives me that error
2018-03-04 17:34:41	maksim_	Well how can I than achieve my goal: set one default dns for all interfaces
2018-03-04 17:35:15	MrElendig	just set it in the profile
2018-03-04 17:35:33	Scimmia	maksim_: why would the interface matter?
2018-03-04 17:37:16	maksim_	Scimmia: well, i use two interfaces alternating
2018-03-04 17:38:13	ilmostro	that can be also accomplished on the dhcp server, which is usually the router.  That way, the dhcp server offers dns servers to the dhcp clients, including any interface on your system

2018-03-04 17:42:36	maksim_	I was about to set up dnscrypt. For that I have to set the dns server either statically in the gui or in resolv.conf.

2018-03-04 17:48:09	frostschutz	BoBeR182, the message you posted earlier is what you get if you unplug a drive without umounting/properly ejecting it first. the filesystem tried to write to a device that was no longer connected to the system, so it lost the write and is left in a corrupt state

2018-03-04 17:49:35	frostschutz	BoBeR182, don't fsck sdd1, it is not a filesystem but LUKS and fsck is more likely to destroy the LUKS header than fix anything
2018-03-04 17:50:05	BoBeR182	then why would someone tell me to run it on that
2018-03-04 17:50:05	BoBeR182	so what do I fsck?

2018-03-04 17:51:09	frostschutz	 LUKS devices once open are /dev/mapper/something - but if you still have the old container there that is referring to the device before removal, you have to get rid of that first
2018-03-04 17:53:01	ilmostro	frostschutz: thanks for catching that :)
2018-03-04 17:54:15	maksim_	Scimmia: ok, but all the other methods involve "protecting" resolv.conf from overwriting. Thats kinda silly in my eyes. That particular idea is neat and tidy - if it would work
2018-03-04 17:54:32	MrElendig	ffs just set the dns in the profile already
2018-03-04 17:54:42	MrElendig	you would be done and have it solved by now

2018-03-04 18:03:30	guys	useful in the event that you frequently rebuild -git packages with minor changes
2018-03-04 18:03:33	occultus	akela: 40 mins to "Check for working C compiler" is definitely wrong

2018-03-04 18:04:13	frostschutz	akela, how much stuff do you even build? not worth it plus a risk factor as there is a chance it might yield wrong results.

2018-03-04 18:24:25	e7th04sh	the tearing is diagonal at least in the uper left part of the screen
2018-03-04 18:24:42	MrElendig	known issue with ff itself
2018-03-04 18:25:10	e7th04sh	oh indeed google recognizes diagonal tearing
2018-03-04 18:25:54	e7th04sh	now I don't have much experience with this, how do I know which card is even used?
2018-03-04 18:26:26	Mart|n	add option ........ Option "TearFree" "on" .....xorg conf
2018-03-04 18:27:15	Shapeshifter	Is there a better alternative to pulseaudio-equalizer? It introduces a ridiculous amount of latency.
2018-03-04 18:27:32	Shapeshifter	I heard there's veromix but it's not even in AUR
2018-03-04 18:28:06	e7th04sh	Mart|n: what does this even do
2018-03-04 18:28:26	Mart|n	fixes tearing on amd gpus
2018-03-04 18:29:24	MrElendig	xorg.conf.d not xorg.conf
2018-03-04 18:29:42	MrElendig	also it doesn't fix it, it just tries to make them less noticable
2018-03-04 18:30:42	occultus	cant the xfce compositor fix tearing?
2018-03-04 18:30:45	occultus	it's just a checkbox iirc
2018-03-04 18:31:07	e7th04sh	so is this firefox on amd gpu issue, or is this two unrelated issues that i should first find out which one i'm having?
2018-03-04 18:31:33	MrElendig	only way to really fix tearing is by having the computer and monitor talk about when to render things
2018-03-04 18:32:52	e7th04sh	one would have supposed that it's not such a big deal
2018-03-04 18:33:16	ilmostro	vsync?
2018-03-04 18:33:34	Hell-Razor	Anybody run with the intel wireless 8265? It uses the iwlwifi drivers.. I am getting the error "Could not configure driver mode" , "deinit ifname=enp0s31f6 disabled_11b_rates=0" "failed to initialize driver interface"
2018-03-04 18:34:02	Hell-Razor	I am just doing wpa_supplicant -B -i enp0s31f -c<(wpa_passphrase "SSID" "PW")
2018-03-04 18:34:04	e7th04sh	ok i'm gonna go through AMDGPU page top to bottom first
2018-03-04 18:34:13	e7th04sh	should I install Vulkan?
2018-03-04 18:34:23	Tom^	isnt tearfree limited to xf86-video-intel anyhow
2018-03-04 18:34:26	MrElendig	those are different things
2018-03-04 18:34:28	ilmostro	Hell-Razor: that's a wifi interface; you are specifying a name that corresponds to an ethernet interface
2018-03-04 18:34:29	MrElendig	Tom^: no
2018-03-04 18:34:39	Hell-Razor	ilbelkyr oh, that may explain it lol
2018-03-04 18:35:13	Hell-Razor	ilmostro Shouldnt ifconfig show my wireless?
2018-03-04 18:35:19	e7th04sh	it seems it's up to me to choose between va-api and vdpau, so which one?
2018-03-04 18:35:49	FriendlyMan	occultus: xfce built in compositor tearing can sometimes be handled inside driver/kernel version, or switching to compton compositor. compiz as a test too. if compiz has no tearing, you're video driver is probably working properly.
2018-03-04 18:35:52	MrElendig	Hell-Razor: don't use ifconfig
2018-03-04 18:35:56	Hell-Razor	ip addr?
2018-03-04 18:36:02	MrElendig	ip l
2018-03-04 18:36:07	MrElendig	rfkill list all
2018-03-04 18:36:26	MrElendig	iw dev
2018-03-04 18:36:32	Hell-Razor	So theres a lot lol
2018-03-04 18:37:02	MrElendig	if it is hardblocked it might not show in ip/iw
2018-03-04 18:37:19	Hell-Razor	Its not
2018-03-04 18:37:19	e7th04sh	yeah, first i should check if i even have tearing outside firefox
2018-03-04 18:37:23	Hell-Razor	I got it, its probing an address atm
2018-03-04 18:37:24	Hell-Razor	and bingo
2018-03-04 18:37:43	ilmostro	Hell-Razor: what's the name of it, out of curiousity
2018-03-04 18:38:25	Hell-Razor	wlp4s0 ilmostro
2018-03-04 18:38:36	ilmostro	👍
2018-03-04 18:38:52	e7th04sh	is there some tearing test or should I write one on my own?
2018-03-04 18:39:07	Hell-Razor	This is strange.. I hate UEFI so I booted biosinstead and its not seeing my hardware raid... It sees all the devices though
2018-03-04 18:39:43	Hell-Razor	I know I can just mdadm them but just saying
2018-03-04 18:39:46	e7th04sh	also how do I find out which gpu is actually in use
2018-03-04 18:40:21	MrElendig	if you have a picture, it is in use
2018-03-04 18:40:29	e7th04sh	you do realize i have two gpus?
2018-03-04 18:40:59	e7th04sh	there is also hd intel on this laptop and it's driver is loaded too
2018-03-04 18:41:08	MrElendig	you did not mention that
2018-03-04 18:41:28	e7th04sh	sorry. it's pretty much standard with laptops now I think though
2018-03-04 18:41:31	MrElendig	vga_switcharoo etc
2018-03-04 18:41:47	occultus	for desktops, generally whichever gpu the monitor is plugged into is used. each laptop can be its own special nightmare with two gpus
2018-03-04 18:41:58	MrElendig	see the hybrid graphics page on the wiki
2018-03-04 18:42:11	BoBeR182	rm: cannot remove '/media/Storage': Device or resource busy
2018-03-04 18:42:15	BoBeR182	how do I see what's blocking it?
2018-03-04 18:42:26	e7th04sh	yeah thank you, reading it now
2018-03-04 18:42:27	occultus	BoBeR182: there's probably something mounted there
2018-03-04 18:42:45	BoBeR182	ther's not
2018-03-04 18:42:47	BoBeR182	my harddrive mounts to storage1
2018-03-04 18:42:49	BoBeR182	for some reason
2018-03-04 18:42:51	MrElendig	lsof
2018-03-04 18:42:54	occultus	BoBeR182: then lsof
2018-03-04 18:42:57	BoBeR182	I want it to mount to storage
2018-03-04 18:44:52	e7th04sh	wow looks like a nightmare
2018-03-04 18:49:13	occultus	e7th04sh: the nightmare is often more about figuring out which information applies to you and which is irrelevant
2018-03-04 18:49:53	e7th04sh	Note: To turn the GPU back on just reboot.
2018-03-04 18:49:57	e7th04sh	niiice. :p
2018-03-04 18:51:27	e7th04sh	so xrandr --listproviders in my case says I have two "providers", that would be my two cards?
2018-03-04 18:51:33	occultus	probably
2018-03-04 18:51:44	e7th04sh	though they are both named modesetting
2018-03-04 18:52:00	occultus	iirc the wiki is a bit outdated, with modern enough combination of drivers and such, only the DRI_PRIME=1 is necessary
2018-03-04 18:52:11	occultus	oh the wiki says that. it's not outdated :P
2018-03-04 18:52:44	occultus	comparing `glxinfo -B` with `DRI_PRIME=1 glxinfo -B` should be enough to tell if you have a "just works" scenario
2018-03-04 18:53:09	e7th04sh	yeah by the way, i have mesa insalled but i don't have glxinfo
2018-03-04 18:53:16	occultus	i think it's in mesa-demos
2018-03-04 18:53:47	e7th04sh	you think right :)
2018-03-04 18:54:01	e7th04sh	[szymon@oblivion xorg.conf.d]$ glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer" OpenGL renderer string: Mesa DRI Intel(R) HD Graphics 620 (Kaby Lake GT2) 
2018-03-04 18:58:09	e7th04sh	ooh okay
2018-03-04 18:58:12	e7th04sh	:>
2018-03-04 18:59:00	e7th04sh	now i wonder whih outputs are accessible to which cards
2018-03-04 18:59:25	e7th04sh	for now I am using only the built-in screen, but I will work toward a hardcore multiscreen setup you know :>
2018-03-04 19:00:05	mpan	e7th04sh: see dirs in “/sys/class/drm”… not that people with proprietary nvidia were reporting this dir is missing. But still you may try.
2018-03-04 19:00:18	mpan	*s/not/note
2018-03-04 19:00:37	gregor3005	hi, anybody use "ktimer"? and tips for a notification pop?
2018-03-04 19:02:46	madd_step	Hello everyone, im having an issue with systemd timedatectl if anyone has some time to help me take a look at it that would be awesome. I'm currently traveling for business to a timezone that is 1 hour behind my home time timedatectl says its syncing the time but shows my timezone as what it is back home. I did look at the Arch Wiki and it tells me to restart systemd-networkd I've tried this and got
2018-03-04 19:02:47	madd_step	nowhere, any ideas on what else i can look at?
2018-03-04 19:04:06	metastable	madd_step: It's syncing time according to UTC, but displaying time in the time zone that's set. Change the timezone.
2018-03-04 19:04:31	occultus	e7th04sh: did you try running glxinfo with DRI_PRIME=1 ?
2018-03-04 19:05:08	madd_step	metastable: will I need to do this manually or can systemd handle this for me somehow?
2018-03-04 19:05:25	BoBeR182	lsof listed deluge as the culprit
2018-03-04 19:05:41	BoBeR182	but i stopped deluge and I still can't unmount the /media/storage
2018-03-04 19:06:00	metastable	madd_step: Don't know about an automated solution. That's a bit complex. So timedatectl set-timezone <timezone> would be your friend.
2018-03-04 19:06:04	thrice	madd_step: timedatectl --help   is pretty straight-forward :-)
2018-03-04 19:06:12	occultus	madd_step: so you want to detect where you are physically located and set the timezone to that automatically?
2018-03-04 19:06:24	e7th04sh	occultus: yeah, it's fine
2018-03-04 19:06:29	madd_step	occultus correct
2018-03-04 19:07:05	occultus	metastable: see the tip at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Time#Time_zone
2018-03-04 19:07:05	@phrik	Title: Time - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
2018-03-04 19:07:10	occultus	whoops, madd_step: ^
2018-03-04 19:07:44	occultus	note that the geolocation solution may give you the wrong timezone if you use a VPN
2018-03-04 19:07:49	e7th04sh	i have some very weird problem that i observed on tremulous which may be either related to network or gpu
2018-03-04 19:08:04	e7th04sh	so i'll do some, umm, extensive testing now
2018-03-04 19:09:08	madd_step	occultus thank you i did not see that :)
2018-03-04 19:37:57	alhirzel	hey, I want to create an AUR package for OMPython, which installs correctly using pip. is there a template that I can follow?
2018-03-04 19:38:25	alhirzel	I looked at the wiki, which said just calling pip is not preferred
2018-03-04 19:39:07	occultus	alhirzel: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Python_package_guidelines ?
2018-03-04 19:39:08	@phrik	Title: Python package guidelines - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
2018-03-04 19:39:57	alhirzel	occultus: didn't see the link there, my bad
2018-03-04 19:40:02	abc_	alhirzel: there's a tool called `pip2pkgbuild`, it may has some help.
2018-03-04 19:40:08	alhirzel	thanks!
2018-03-04 19:40:41	alhirzel	I'll look into that too abc_; that sounds even more convenient
2018-03-04 19:40:51	abc_	alhirzel: ;)
2018-03-04 19:42:54	LiquidPL	is there someone i can ask to take a look at mono? it seems to be not updated since somewhere around last year (also flagged a month ago, but no one seems to have taken care of it :/)
2018-03-04 19:46:03	⚡	fstd_ is now known as fstd
2018-03-04 19:48:30	xvicarious	So I'm having issues with my fancontrol. They'll turn on full blast. Then they'll turn off. Then it repeats. My fancontrol config is here: https://gist.github.com/XVicarious/c4dce23f8088d4105c9ca3da8ad57cc4

2018-03-04 19:50:13	thrice	LiquidPL: unfortunately, you cannot.  It's up to motivated arch developers to maintain packages, if interest is lost, you have to wait for someone to pick it up (or, do the update yourself)
2018-03-04 19:50:41	LiquidPL	well it is in the core repos i think
2018-03-04 19:50:45	LiquidPL	can't do much about it
2018-03-04 19:51:04	thrice	I mean compiling the update yourself
2018-03-04 19:51:10	LiquidPL	fair
2018-03-04 19:51:32	LiquidPL	but it would be good to have the package up to date for everyone so that's why I asked
2018-03-04 19:51:35	LiquidPL	but thanks anyway

2018-03-04 20:31:09	SirShalam	Hello?
2018-03-04 20:31:42	Namarrgon	hello
2018-03-04 20:31:45	oats	hello
2018-03-04 20:33:33	illkitten	hello
2018-03-04 20:34:33	SirShalam	Ok cool. Sorry I have a bit of a weird problem. Opengl won't work at all and I dont really know where to start. If I try a opengl program in firefox, wine, ect it wont work. Ive tried using glxinfo and I dotn have it. Ive tried searching around and I cant get any solutions.
2018-03-04 20:34:56	Namarrgon	install the package that provides glxinfo
2018-03-04 20:35:03	Namarrgon	!pacman-file
2018-03-04 20:35:04	@phrik	Find out what package owns a file, even if the package isn't installed. pacman -Fsy <file> (similar to !pkgfile)
2018-03-04 20:35:17	Namarrgon	run it and post the complete output to a paste service
2018-03-04 20:36:20	SirShalam	Ok one min. 
2018-03-04 20:43:47	SirShalam	Rip when I try to use a paste service on glxinfo it doesnt put out the whole command I just get this http://ix.io/grp
2018-03-04 20:44:35	Namarrgon	did you redirect stderr too?
2018-03-04 20:44:43	SirShalam	Huh?
2018-03-04 20:45:11	Namarrgon	"glxinfo |& curl -F c=@- https://ptpb.pw"
2018-03-04 20:45:12	@phrik	Title: pb (at ptpb.pw)
2018-03-04 20:48:55	SirShalam	Still the same thing. I guess I'll have to type it out https://ptpb.pw/0-8n
2018-03-04 20:50:15	occultus	SirShalam: is there more?
2018-03-04 20:50:32	SirShalam	Yeah theres more that the command outputs into terminal
2018-03-04 20:50:46	SirShalam	I guess you want me to type it all out? Lol
2018-03-04 20:50:59	occultus	i thought you were saying that that was what you typed out
2018-03-04 20:51:00	fryfrog	Is there a better arch linux channel for zfs on root? :)
2018-03-04 20:51:13	SirShalam	No sorry it wasnt one sec
2018-03-04 20:51:30	occultus	SirShalam: does everything with multiple lines paste wrong or just glxinfo
2018-03-04 20:52:03	SirShalam	X Error of failed request: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
2018-03-04 20:52:08	SirShalam	opps too early
2018-03-04 20:52:21	Scimmia	fryfrog: what's the issue?
2018-03-04 20:53:48	fryfrog	At first boot, it wasn't able to find my root
2018-03-04 20:53:55	fryfrog	Should have taken a picture :p
2018-03-04 20:54:21	fryfrog	let me get chrooted again so I can give some actual setup examples
2018-03-04 20:54:28	SirShalam	No opengl programs will open at all. And thats about all I know. Firefox complains I dont have it and I wanted to try cave story on wine before unreal tournament and it wont open due to opengl not working.
2018-03-04 20:54:37	Scimmia	fryfrog: so the initramfs wasn't set up right? Or the kernel command line?
2018-03-04 20:54:46	Namarrgon	SirShalam: did you update any packages?
2018-03-04 20:55:21	SirShalam	Yeah I just did a update today but its been broken since I installed arch.
2018-03-04 20:55:28	bq	inb4 partial upgrade
2018-03-04 20:56:08	SirShalam	Nope I always -Syu

2018-03-04 20:56:30	Namarrgon	SirShalam: was the kernel updated?
2018-03-04 20:56:32	Scimmia	SirShalam: what vid drivers?
2018-03-04 20:56:44	fryfrog	Scimmia: yet in busy box, I could `zpool import -d /dev/disk/by-id rpool`
2018-03-04 20:57:03	fryfrog	initramfs has zfs and is built w/ it :/
2018-03-04 20:57:18	SirShalam	My drivers are nvidia-340xx-utils Im running a 750 ti
2018-03-04 20:57:21	CompanionCube	so what's the actual error it gave?
2018-03-04 20:57:39	Namarrgon	SirShalam: that'S the wrong driver for that gpu, you need 'nvidia'
2018-03-04 20:57:59	Namarrgon	no wonder it never worked
2018-03-04 20:58:45	SirShalam	It wont let me install it. I guess I have to drop out of xorg. One min
2018-03-04 20:58:58	Scimmia	fryfrog: that's an odd notation, where did you find it?
2018-03-04 20:58:58	Namarrgon	what won't let you install it?
2018-03-04 20:59:01	leggomyhueco	Hey guys, total arch noob here looking to dual boot with windows. I recently got a second, much faster hard drive and installed windows on it, leaving the other windows install on the first hdd, and I think the second install is using some of the partitions of the first, namely the EFI partition
2018-03-04 20:59:39	fryfrog	Scimmia: I'm afraid I mixed a little bit of Ubuntu root zfs, if you mean the pool name.
2018-03-04 21:00:01	leggomyhueco	Could anyone take a look at this and tell if I need to move the partitions over so I can format the first HDD as a data drive when I install arch? https://i.imgur.com/vs1hMtt.jpg
2018-03-04 21:00:07	SirShalam	Pacman wont let me install it. It says it wil break the 340xx drivers
2018-03-04 21:00:12	Scimmia	fryfrog: yeah, that's your problem
2018-03-04 21:00:20	Namarrgon	SirShalam: get rid of the 340xx driver
2018-03-04 21:00:40	fryfrog	Scimmia: You think the name of the pool matters?
2018-03-04 21:01:00	Scimmia	fryfrog: the initramfs has no idea what to do with that notation at all

2018-03-04 21:17:39	guys	ultimately, you can do anything systemd-boot can do using grub as well, with the advantage of also having ext4/btrfs/etc drivers... but I'm not actually sure about zfs drivers -_-

2018-03-05 15:51:01	mgolisch	i think it verifies it has the rootfs by looking for /sysroot/etc/os-release
2018-03-05 15:52:50	mgolisch	systemctl status sysroot.mount should show the mount command it ran or just look at the output of mount in the emergency shell

2018-03-05 16:01:56	ilmostro	mfrinnstrom: yeah, as MrElendig pointed out, usually that's happened to me at times when rootfs is not being found for some reason during early boot process
2018-03-05 16:02:31	mfrinnstrom	I have tried setting it up with encryption and systemd-boot. I guess I did something wrong with that

2018-03-05 16:03:50	ilmostro	nemesit|znc: IIRC, the pro stuff allows more control, features from host/admin perspective; shouldn't limit you in any way within the guest.  I, too, prefer libvirt :)

2018-03-05 16:09:30	ilmostro	technically, libvirt is the management layer, as mgolisch pointed out; although, kvm/libvirt have been used interchangeably at times, since libvirt is the default on linux :)

2018-03-05 16:11:19	ilmostro	grazzolini: I think nemesit|znc and mgolisch pointed to proxmox, which apparently does not use libvirt, but its own thing

2018-03-05 16:16:22	ilmostro	mgolisch: that's interesting; I would've thought of other reasons that vmware might be more versatile; though, I think I know what you mean with the incremental backups.  FWIW, there might be solutions in OpenSource world (libvirt) that can be better than others.

2018-03-05 16:17:10	Ingar	whoever helped me with my systemd-boot menu not appearing: if there's an efivar LoaderConfigTimeout, systemd-boot ignores the timeout from loader.conf. In the end, I changed the efivar from "0\x00\x00\x00" to "5\x00\x00\x00"

2018-03-05 16:20:48	mgolisch	think qemu supports incremental backup right now but some quite essential features like persisting the dirty block bitmaps is quite new and i dont think any of the management tools support that yet, its quite useless if you have to start a new fullbackup chain just because you migrated the vm to another host or restarted the vm.
2018-03-05 16:21:22	DoomPatrol	mgolisch: what are you calling a backup
2018-03-05 16:21:27	DoomPatrol	a "image" is not a backup
2018-03-05 16:21:40	ilmostro	snapshots, no?
2018-03-05 16:21:49	DoomPatrol	that is a point in time to create a backup /from/
2018-03-05 16:21:58	DoomPatrol	e.g. take snapshot, backup actual damn data
2018-03-05 16:22:12	DoomPatrol	idk /how/ many times that ppl use a image for a backup and it doesn't work as expected
2018-03-05 16:22:23	mgolisch	why wouldnt that work?
2018-03-05 16:22:27	DoomPatrol	now there are some pieces of software that do block level backups
2018-03-05 16:22:46	mgolisch	thats basicaly how every vm backup software works
2018-03-05 16:22:55	DoomPatrol	mmm no
2018-03-05 16:23:09	DoomPatrol	i can't recall the proprietary one im thinking of
2018-03-05 16:23:25	DoomPatrol	that does it at the block level, (its a 3rd party kernel driver or something like that)
2018-03-05 16:23:41	ilmostro	Parallels, maybe
2018-03-05 16:23:44	DoomPatrol	mgolisch: idk, i worked at a $cloud provider once
2018-03-05 16:24:02	DoomPatrol	ilmostro: nah, i stay away from them nowdays, (not that they are bad, just weird)
2018-03-05 16:24:21	DoomPatrol	mgolisch: and numerous times, "I created a backup "image" and i restored it but it doesn't work"
2018-03-05 16:25:04	DoomPatrol	but i understand why ppl think that way, maybe tech will get there (or already is)
2018-03-05 16:25:59	DoomPatrol	main thing about images is for things like databases (or dynamic data) is that you're not properly backing up the data
2018-03-05 16:28:31	ilmostro	sounds like a data dump, rather than disk copy type of thing
2018-03-05 16:31:58	DoomPatrol	ilmostro: main point is that a "image" is a container and it's quite difficult to discern if the actual contents are valid.
2018-03-05 16:32:07	▷	DoomPatrol ends random virt image rant
2018-03-05 16:33:34	ilmostro	virt word
2018-03-05 16:34:26	mgolisch	for stuff you care about you can easily do something about using custom freeze/thaw hooks in the guest agent
2018-03-05 16:34:31	mgolisch	+that
2018-03-05 16:35:03	DoomPatrol	mgolisch: it's not as easy as you think
2018-03-05 16:35:10	DoomPatrol	e.g. vanilla openstack doens't have a guest agent
2018-03-05 16:35:18	mgolisch	vmware does
2018-03-05 16:35:21	DoomPatrol	and i dislike having to write my own from scratch
2018-03-05 16:35:21	mgolisch	qemu does
2018-03-05 16:35:28	mgolisch	all i ever used
2018-03-05 16:35:53	DoomPatrol	mgolisch: you sure qemu does? i know it has a interface but i didn't think it had a actual client
2018-03-05 16:37:09	ilmostro	I know I've seen qemu-guest-agent packages; never used it.  Maybe that's just on the host side?
2018-03-05 16:37:24	DoomPatrol	https://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Qemu_guest_agent - yeah you have to basically create your own
2018-03-05 16:37:25	phrik	Title: Qemu guest agent - Libvirt Wiki (at wiki.libvirt.org)
2018-03-05 16:37:40	Butch3R	Hi
2018-03-05 16:37:46	DoomPatrol	basically it has a "agent" however you still have to actually code what it does which is a huge PITA
2018-03-05 16:41:42	lo1	whoever read my b****ing about iptables 24 hours ago: I'm a moron
2018-03-05 16:42:11	lo1	those ACCEPT rules were added because of loopack, bridge and tap interface o a VM i use within arch
2018-03-05 16:45:12	lo1	iptables is indeed a sane tool,only the -L switch wasn't showing the interfaces and i need to cure my amnesia
2018-03-05 16:45:17	mgolisch	also the majority of our vms use windows and vss takes that whole thing to a  completely different level, where most stuff implements so called vss writers that make sure the product produces consistent files in the snapshot when the vss framework takes a filesystem snapshot
2018-03-05 16:45:26	mgolisch	so there thats even less of a concern
2018-03-05 16:48:20	mgolisch	also vm image backups are so convenient, not having to mess with backup agents in every vm, especialy with more advanced backup software like veeam, that does post processing of the image files, like it indexes the filesystems to allow restore of single files or for supported applications like exchange ,acitve directory or mssql or oracle allows restoration of application level elements like
2018-03-05 16:48:22	mgolisch	mails,mailboxes,user accounts and other ldap obects including single properties or in case of databases restoration of tables and stuff
2018-03-05 16:49:40	kaiver	Hi all, only one question, this should be a stupid thing I'm doing wrong but I cannot find sense to that problem.
2018-03-05 16:49:42	kaiver	In a recent Arch minimal install when I login and type "systemctl start NetworkManger" I can access the Network correctly, but when I type "systemctl enable NetworkManager" and I reboot the system the OS gets blocked at login and I cannot make login despite the prompt is here if I type nothing comes to the prompt.
2018-03-05 16:50:35	kaiver	Anyone knows what could be the problem? maybe I need to install another package for NetworkManager or something? :S
2018-03-05 16:54:47	Psi-Jack	NetworkManager has nothing to do with logging into the system itself.
2018-03-05 16:55:11	kaiver	Yes
2018-03-05 16:55:26	kaiver	NetworkManager should only take care about network adapters and dhcp
2018-03-05 16:56:05	kaiver	but for some reason I enable NetworkManager in systemctl and restart the computer it will get blocked at login in the next reboot
2018-03-05 16:56:23	Psi-Jack	And "Arch minimal install?" Arch is always minimal from the start.
2018-03-05 16:56:24	kaiver	I don't think this is a login problem is a problem with the computer that gets completely blocked
2018-03-05 16:56:44	kaiver	I mean a install with only core
2018-03-05 16:56:50	kaiver	and NetworkManager
2018-03-05 16:56:52	kaiver	no more packages
2018-03-05 16:57:02	Psi-Jack	Yes.... That is a arch install. :p
2018-03-05 16:57:04	kaiver	well and grub xD
2018-03-05 16:57:12	kaiver	yep
2018-03-05 16:57:41	sylvblck	this is how every arch system starts
2018-03-05 16:57:51	kaiver	I am wondering if maybe the enable command symlinks the NetworkManager with a wrong adapter and that causes the system blocks
2018-03-05 16:57:54	Psi-Jack	To add "minimal" to the description of this makes me wonder if you actually mean some other arch fork, like Antergos.
2018-03-05 16:58:03	kaiver	Nope xD
2018-03-05 16:58:06	kaiver	Arch linux :)
2018-03-05 16:58:10	kaiver	x86_64
2018-03-05 16:59:00	kaiver	making partitions with fsdisk and so on: 4.15.6-1-ARCH
2018-03-05 16:59:07	kaiver	(uname-r)
2018-03-05 16:59:09	sylvblck	like maybe 99% of this channel
2018-03-05 16:59:30	demonicmaniac3	you can list the dependencies of units
2018-03-05 17:00:08	kaiver	yep
2018-03-05 17:00:18	kaiver	I will try to copy them here
2018-03-05 17:00:29	demonicmaniac3	and sounds to me like you just need to either specify the network key for networkmanager and default to connect and/or a timeout if none is found 
2018-03-05 17:01:02	kaiver	you mean with systemctl status or something else?
2018-03-05 17:01:58	ArtiqKnight	Hey fellas, got new internet and it has ipv6. test-ipv6 gives me the all go, but I can't ping it from outside networks, only inside networks. My modem firewall is off atm and my pc uses ufw with the standard rules. Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong?
2018-03-05 17:02:43	drathir	Psi-Jack: networkmanager indeed have something with user login not directy but still allow user to start connections as non root or at least that was in past, personally only netctl using...
2018-03-05 17:03:12	kaiver	" to either specify the network key for networkmanager and default to connect and/or a timeout if none is found" <- That could be the problem.
2018-03-05 17:03:13	Psi-Jack	NetworkManager itself has nothing to do with logging in.
2018-03-05 17:03:18	Namarrgon	ArtiqKnight: ufw comes with rules?
2018-03-05 17:03:31	drathir	kaiver: check if that hang service isnt systemd network coliding with networkmanage...
2018-03-05 17:03:45	drathir	Namarrgon: yep it was...
2018-03-05 17:03:46	Psi-Jack	Namarrgon: Yes. Block everything. :p
2018-03-05 17:03:55	kaiver	This is a wired connection, I will search for docs about what you have just told me, maybe is the right way
2018-03-05 17:03:57	mgolisch	ArtiqKnight: so your computer has a global unicast ipv6 address?
2018-03-05 17:04:07	Namarrgon	ArtiqKnight: then switch it off and try again
2018-03-05 17:04:13	drathir	Namarrgon: /etc/ufw/applications.d/
2018-03-05 17:04:13	kaiver	Thanks Psi-Jack for your tip! :D
2018-03-05 17:04:19	Psi-Jack	hehe
2018-03-05 17:05:03	ArtiqKnight	mgolisch: first block is 2a02, so it's not link local
2018-03-05 17:05:09	mgolisch	okay
2018-03-05 17:05:20	demonicmaniac3	kaiver: just pastebin systemd unit dependencies and bootchart for a boot which "hangs"
2018-03-05 17:05:30	RetardedOnion	when i lock xfce with xflock (slock) and wake it up again the screen is a solid color(red/purple/whatever)anybody experienced that? i can still type the password and continue.
2018-03-05 17:07:00	Psi-Jack	RetardedOnion: configure slock to not use that color.
2018-03-05 17:07:17	Psi-Jack	Default is some awful red background or something, IIRC.
2018-03-05 17:08:20	RetardedOnion	thank you. maybe ill try it out
2018-03-05 17:08:34	Psi-Jack	slock -c 000000 for example will make the background black.
2018-03-05 17:16:15	RetardedOnion	Psi-Jack: light-locker does the exact same for what i want and i dont have to recompile. thank you anyway
2018-03-05 17:16:46	Psi-Jack	Well, if you use light-locker, then that's better anyway.
2018-03-05 17:17:03	Psi-Jack	Err, if you use lightdm, use of light-locker is pretty good. :)
2018-03-05 17:17:30	Psi-Jack	You don't have to recompile slock to change the background color. :p
2018-03-05 17:17:57	RetardedOnion	Psi-Jack: u sure? arch wiki said so
2018-03-05 17:18:01	Psi-Jack	"you"

2018-03-05 17:18:36	RetardedOnion	"Configuration is done by editing the config.h header file and then recompiling the package. After configuration you should create a package. "
2018-03-05 17:19:13	Psi-Jack	If you want me to answer you, don't use shtspk, for I will not answer the asked question.
2018-03-05 17:19:51	RetardedOnion	i am sorry. wont happen again
2018-03-05 17:21:37	Psi-Jack	slock -c 000000, can be used to set the background, as I mentioned earlier. With something like xautolock, you can tell xautolock to run slock -c 000000, and to lock the desktop you could use xautolock as well to initiate an immediate lock. Just some examples.
2018-03-05 17:21:54	Psi-Jack	I used to to this, and decided to ultimately use light-locker with light-locker-command.
2018-03-05 17:22:33	Psi-Jack	Just depends on preference. :)
2018-03-05 17:23:40	RetardedOnion	Nice to know. Well if a locker works, there really is no preference involved other than speed. which is no preference...
2018-03-05 17:24:25	Psi-Jack	There's some nuances with light-locker that I don't, and do like at the same time, though.
2018-03-05 17:24:27	ccromer	anyone here familar with the process of updating the built toolchain(gcc with mpfr)?
2018-03-05 17:24:47	ccromer	s/built/build/
2018-03-05 17:25:25	Psi-Jack	light-locker does lock via policykit methods, so things like synergy cannot be used on a locked synergy client session, so thankfully I have my multi-device wireless keyboard that I can use to simply quickly unlock the laptop (synergy client).
2018-03-05 17:25:52	Psi-Jack	KDE used policykit methods as well, but still allowed synergy client stuff to work.
2018-03-05 17:26:57	RetardedOnion	synergy sometimes steals my mouse and keyboard.. not a big fan... still a necessity

2018-03-05 21:08:26	beest	guess it depends on the size of your foot
2018-03-05 21:13:15	notadrop	is it normal for a distribution to not include telnet by default...?
2018-03-05 21:13:21	notadrop	I've never seen this before
2018-03-05 21:13:27	notadrop	It's not Arch, btw

2018-03-05 21:14:49	mpan	Also the question makes as much sense as if it is normal that you don’t get a pigeon to carry your letters with every distro. It’s 2018.

2018-03-05 21:18:56	guys	sehro: And, it is required by fish, grml-zsh-config, and xorg-xinit, which coincidentally are also terrible things!
2018-03-05 21:19:03	sehro	Mart|n: it was tried. 4chan happened to it.

2018-03-05 21:21:41	guys	that sounds like netctl all right
2018-03-05 21:24:44	bushidoboy	I'm getting popping sounds on my external audio interface when using it's headphone out, but not through the laptop's built in audio jack

2018-03-05 21:26:51	bushidoboy	sehro: a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 first gen. About 3 years old I'd say
2018-03-05 21:26:56	bushidoboy	or are you asking about the laptop
2018-03-05 21:28:02	sehro	bushidoboy: the interface
2018-03-05 21:28:13	bushidoboy	the interface details are above ^
2018-03-05 21:28:14	sehro	although might as well get the laptop as well
2018-03-05 21:28:24	sehro	since now i have a suspicion

2018-03-05 21:28:32	beest	bushidoboy: sounds like the buffer's too small
2018-03-05 21:28:40	esph	Mart|n: though if you need something like Blender, you probably just want Blender
2018-03-05 21:28:55	bushidoboy	beest buffer being too small has only really bit me when using Bitwig
2018-03-05 21:29:14	bushidoboy	even then, tried adjusting the buffer for pulse I believe and didn't have any more success
2018-03-05 21:29:38	sehro	bushidoboy: to confirm a thought, can you also provide computer model and/or cpu model info?
2018-03-05 21:29:38	bushidoboy	It's an intermittent pop, comes in once every couple of seconds
2018-03-05 21:30:15	bushidoboy	sehro the laptop is a Dell something or other, don't have the exact model number
2018-03-05 21:30:40	beest	is this one of the USB scarletts?
2018-03-05 21:30:46	sehro	beest: it is
2018-03-05 21:30:49	bushidoboy	beest it is
2018-03-05 21:31:01	sehro	bushidoboy: can you give me the output of "lscpu |grep 'Model name'"
2018-03-05 21:31:29	bushidoboy	Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz
2018-03-05 21:31:50	bushidoboy	though this started happening before spectre and meltdown I believe
2018-03-05 21:32:03	sehro	ahh
2018-03-05 21:32:05	bushidoboy	I've just been living with it and trying to find solutions here and there but it's driving me up a wall
2018-03-05 21:32:10	sehro	you have a frequency scaling cpu
2018-03-05 21:32:26	sehro	that device does not ... play well with frequency scaling
2018-03-05 21:32:34	bushidoboy	oh, beautiful
2018-03-05 21:32:35	demonicmaniac3	then it would also happen internally
2018-03-05 21:32:39	demonicmaniac3	he said it's only exterally
2018-03-05 21:32:43	bushidoboy	^
2018-03-05 21:32:59	bushidoboy	off the laptop headphone out I don't get it at all
2018-03-05 21:33:08	demonicmaniac3	most likely culprits are broken jack sensing and dual jacks for microphone and headphones
2018-03-05 21:33:26	sehro	demonicmaniac3: the audio interface itself is bad with frequency scaling. there's actually a fair bit of google result and forum noise on this
2018-03-05 21:33:27	bushidoboy	And for the last couple of years it's been fine, only in the last 2 months or so has it gone poppy
2018-03-05 21:33:40	sehro	and internal audio would not be affected by issues an external interface is having regardless
2018-03-05 21:33:41	demonicmaniac3	sehro: yes. but then it happens always
2018-03-05 21:33:50	bushidoboy	demonicmaniac3 I would like to point out that jack isn't running when I'm getting pops
2018-03-05 21:34:01	demonicmaniac3	because scaling affects it in general on the buffers and the card and not just specific jacks
2018-03-05 21:34:02	bushidoboy	jack doesn't run automatically for me, I only enable it when using bitwig
2018-03-05 21:34:10	sehro	demonicmaniac3: eh, who knows. weird external devices are weird. he could TRY disabling freq.scale temporarily, see if it helps
2018-03-05 21:34:15	demonicmaniac3	bushidoboy: audio jack is in the jack you plug stuff into
2018-03-05 21:34:22	demonicmaniac3	not the jack server
2018-03-05 21:34:24	bushidoboy	ah, not jack server
2018-03-05 21:34:26	bushidoboy	got it
2018-03-05 21:34:38	demonicmaniac3	modern shit has sensing stuff to auto mute stuff and enable stuff and such
2018-03-05 21:34:48	sehro	it could also be a dirty physical jack, yeh
2018-03-05 21:34:56	demonicmaniac3	and i remember having to dick about a lot with disabling autosensing stuff because it would fuck me over all the time
2018-03-05 21:35:00	bushidoboy	anything I can provide you guys for you to look at?
2018-03-05 21:35:17	bushidoboy	any configs or files I can upload?
2018-03-05 21:35:28	demonicmaniac3	i wish i could remember what it was
2018-03-05 21:36:09	sehro	bushidoboy: if you install the tool cpupower, you can run a simple command to test and see if freq.scale is the culprit, which can become more agressive as a processor ages
2018-03-05 21:36:38	bushidoboy	already have it installed, what should I run sehro 
2018-03-05 21:36:53	bushidoboy	This laptop is a little younger than the interface, I think like 2.5 years
2018-03-05 21:36:54	sehro	cpupower frequency-set -g performance
2018-03-05 21:37:18	bushidoboy	done
2018-03-05 21:37:24	sehro	then test your usual audio payload, see if it continues
2018-03-05 21:37:46	bushidoboy	I can already say it does. Tried switching to performance about a week ago, still getting issues
2018-03-05 21:37:54	sehro	okay, that rules that out
2018-03-05 21:38:32	sehro	that narrows it down to a) failing interface, b) dirty audio jack, or d) failing usb cable
2018-03-05 21:38:40	sehro	with b being most likely and easiest to fix
2018-03-05 21:39:02	bushidoboy	tried switching out the usb cable a month ago, still happens
2018-03-05 21:39:21	demonicmaniac3	i don't really use pulse, in alsamixer at least you have settings for auto mute enable/disable and disabling all mics and enabling only headphones or speaker and such
2018-03-05 21:39:22	bushidoboy	how would I fix b? Just run an alcohol swab through it?
2018-03-05 21:39:32	sehro	bushidoboy: https://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Headphone-Jack
2018-03-05 21:39:33	phrik	Title: 3 Ways to Clean a Headphone Jack - wikiHow (at www.wikihow.com)
2018-03-05 21:39:34	demonicmaniac3	i'd try muting everything you don't actually use tehre
2018-03-05 21:39:48	sehro	all of method 2 should clean it right out
2018-03-05 21:40:08	bushidoboy	demonicmaniac3 when I first installed linux on this laptop, I tried fiddling with alsa configs for a month and could never get my interface to work. installed pulse and it came to life like magic
2018-03-05 21:40:21	bushidoboy	demonicmaniac3 also already muted non used channels in alsamixer
2018-03-05 21:40:26	bushidoboy	sehro wikihow to the rescue
2018-03-05 21:40:27	demonicmaniac3	Found an Arch thread that has a method of disabling the automatic switching. Edit /etc/pulse/default.pa (gdamjan suggests the alternate ~/.config/pulse/default.pa) to remove the following line: load-module module-switch-on-port-available
2018-03-05 21:40:44	demonicmaniac3	that's to disable jack sensing i guess
2018-03-05 21:41:10	bushidoboy	demonicmaniac3 done that as well, but the new issue that brings up is that my laptop will never sleep cuz it detects the interface as always on
2018-03-05 21:41:23	RawphullCawpter	Any good packages to provide a right click, extract feature? Using Thunar and Ark for what it's worth
2018-03-05 21:41:55	demonicmaniac3	then i'm out of ideas ;/ good luck with people with more experience with audio
2018-03-05 21:42:08	RawphullCawpter	Preferably capable of autodetecting a base folder and making one if not included in the archive. Ark seems to do that already if I open the whole window and extract
2018-03-05 21:42:45	bushidoboy	RawphullCawpter thunar-archive-plugin maybe?

2018-03-05 21:43:22	sehro	bushidoboy: also, what sample rate are you outputting audio at?
2018-03-05 21:43:28	bushidoboy	44.1
2018-03-05 21:43:35	sehro	hmm
2018-03-05 21:43:58	bushidoboy	I swear to moses if it's just the audio jack is dirty I'm gonna have a shitfit
2018-03-05 21:44:13	bushidoboy	Actually, I don't think it's that.
2018-03-05 21:44:40	bushidoboy	Just for shits and giggles, I tried it on my work laptop, which has arch installed and almost the exact same loadout as this one.
2018-03-05 21:44:41	bushidoboy	No pops.
2018-03-05 21:44:56	sehro	huh
2018-03-05 21:45:04	sehro	have you tried a different usb port on the offending system?
2018-03-05 21:45:04	bushidoboy	That's another Dell with an Intel CPU patched for spectre
2018-03-05 21:45:57	bushidoboy	sehro just did. Still popping
2018-03-05 21:46:22	sehro	bushidoboy: hmm, that's very odd. kernel version the same on both?
2018-03-05 21:46:23	RawphullCawpter	bushidoboy, that adds the feature, but it errors with no suitable archive manager. Ark can manually open to extract just fine, though. Some sort of config I need to do and missed?
2018-03-05 21:47:38	bushidoboy	sehro yep, latest kernel on both
2018-03-05 21:47:49	bushidoboy	I'm thinking it's a config issue.
2018-03-05 21:47:58	bushidoboy	Killing pulse to see if it's that
2018-03-05 21:48:10	sehro	i mean, it has to be, if the systems are otherwise similar
2018-03-05 21:49:06	bushidoboy	thinking about just nuking all three sound systems, just need to figure out a way to get all their config files in one shot as well
2018-03-05 21:49:22	bushidoboy	without removing things that depend on them of course, or I'm gonna have a hell of a time reinstalling everything
2018-03-05 21:49:59	iconz	RawphullCawpter: you need something like gnome's file-roller to do that in thunar with thunar-archive-plugin installed
2018-03-05 21:50:05	bushidoboy	^
2018-03-05 21:50:58	RawphullCawpter	iconz, it listed Ark as an installed optional dependency, so shouldn't that suffice?

2018-03-05 22:48:17	Celmor	just wanted to get into boot menu so I could edit the cmdline
2018-03-05 22:48:43	Celmor	but I just edited the entry file now
2018-03-05 22:49:23	esph	Celmor: oh, then you can just hold spacebar in the future
2018-03-05 22:50:09	Celmor	didn't do it
2018-03-05 22:51:21	Celmor	it's a VM I wanted to get into the boot menu, had the console open and held down spacebar while it was rebooting
2018-03-05 23:09:10	esph	Ah, a VM might introduce complications I don't know about, I guess.
2018-03-05 23:21:50	helladen	My QEMU OVMF is not working.
2018-03-05 23:21:52	helladen	It fails to boot the CD ISO.
2018-03-05 23:21:54	helladen	I have went into the Boot Manager and manually tried to start it, but it fails and has no error message.
2018-03-05 23:23:50	Celmor	what's "My QEMU OVMF"? do you mean your qemu VM can't boot the arch iso?
2018-03-05 23:24:01	helladen	Windows ISO.
2018-03-05 23:24:22	Celmor	so what happens if you run your qemu command?
2018-03-05 23:25:24	Mart|n	ive no experience problems loading isos in qemu 
2018-03-05 23:25:27	helladen	I am using Virt-Manager GUI with LibVirt. I see the UEFI Interactive Shell 2.2. I type exit and it goes to the Boot Manager. I then try to start the CD/ROM manually and it just flickers the screen for a moment.
2018-03-05 23:25:42	helladen	I never had any problems until now.
2018-03-05 23:25:50	Celmor	and what after it flickers?
2018-03-05 23:26:10	Mart|n	maybe the uefi rom is outdated
2018-03-05 23:26:44	helladen	I am using the latest Windows 10, but I tried the Arch version and the Arch Wiki didn't have the correct path.
2018-03-05 23:26:46	Celmor	certainly isn't an arch issue, you might have more luck in libvirts channel (#virt on oftc.net)

2018-03-05 23:39:45	helladen	I should of checked the size of the ISO, it was only 64 KB.
2018-03-05 23:39:50	helladen	The download must of failed.

2018-03-05 23:40:37	helladen	Firefox bug I guess.
2018-03-05 23:41:17	mpan	Rather not. Probably server or connection issues.
2018-03-05 23:41:17	helladen	Never had a download problem before, using Chrome. Firefox must've just stopped downloading it for some reason.
2018-03-05 23:41:32	helladen	I think Chrome retries if it fails.
2018-03-05 23:42:12	mpan	If the server sent headers that suggested that this is everything to be sent, a browser can do nothing more.
2018-03-05 23:42:18	Celmor	firefox displays an icon if a download fails and lets you retry by clicking on the circly arrow
2018-03-05 23:44:27	helladen	I got my DPC Latency down to 60 yesterday, was pretty amazed. I had to reset my PC due to GPU passthrough being busted though.
2018-03-05 23:44:42	helladen	It broke randomly.
2018-03-05 23:45:42	Celmor	nothings brakes randomly you just might not see the cause
2018-03-05 23:46:17	Celmor	breaks*
2018-03-05 23:46:18	Mart|n	what ur setup helladen 
2018-03-05 23:47:01	helladen	Nvidia 1060 Skylake 6600k
2018-03-05 23:47:34	Mart|n	guess nvidia 1060 is ur passthru
2018-03-05 23:47:36	helladen	I am going to post my findings, because my config is better than anytihng on the web.
2018-03-05 23:47:46	helladen	I was doing a lot of testing.
2018-03-05 23:47:54	helladen	And spent like all day researching it.
2018-03-05 23:48:16	helladen	Like HPET timer being enabled is a good thing to have.
2018-03-05 23:48:33	helladen	and yeah.
2018-03-05 23:48:56	Celmor	do you also know why?
2018-03-05 23:49:14	helladen	I passthrough Sound Blaster Z soundcard. Linux claims it by default and messes with the state. So I have to use pci-stub and not VFIO-pci.
2018-03-05 23:49:33	helladen	The card is heavily tied to Windows.
2018-03-05 23:50:01	helladen	It took forever to figure out why it wasn't working inside Windows.
2018-03-05 23:50:15	Celmor	linux doesn't claim, the driver does, if you blacklist the driver nothing will claim your device
2018-03-05 23:50:33	helladen	HPET timer is a high precision timer, it helps with multitasking and heavy tasks. It's a setting in the BIOS.
2018-03-05 23:50:42	helladen	I also enable all the other timers to interrupt tasks faster.
2018-03-05 23:50:42	Mart|n	intel only tho
2018-03-05 23:51:03	helladen	Like Hyper-V.
2018-03-05 23:51:17	Celmor	doesn't that interfere with nvidia driver?
2018-03-05 23:51:26	Celmor	code 43 and such
2018-03-05 23:51:30	helladen	No.
2018-03-05 23:51:35	helladen	I figured out how to bypass it.
2018-03-05 23:51:44	helladen	And use Hyper-V, which is great performance for a Windows VM.
2018-03-05 23:51:54	Celmor	you mean <kvm><hidden state='on'/></kvm>
2018-03-05 23:51:59	helladen	No.
2018-03-05 23:52:10	helladen	You need to provide a 12 key hardware key.
2018-03-05 23:52:11	Celmor	well, that needs to be configured at least afaik
2018-03-05 23:52:27	helladen	I lost all my  changes I had, so I need to redo them.
2018-03-05 23:52:31	Celmor	so you have kvm visible to the VM?
2018-03-05 23:52:34	helladen	No.
2018-03-05 23:52:42	helladen	It has to be hidden.
2018-03-05 23:52:55	⚡	cdown_ is now known as cdown
2018-03-05 23:52:56	Celmor	so why did you say no the first time then...
2018-03-05 23:52:58	helladen	But you also need to enable a hardware key. I use libvirt, because it makes it nice to edit and customize VMs.
2018-03-05 23:53:06	helladen	I meant no you need 2 things.
2018-03-05 23:53:08	pankaj	My usb port is not working. Can somebody recommend best way to share file wirelessly in arch?
2018-03-05 23:53:29	Celmor	wirelessly? using what?

2018-03-05 23:57:00	helladen	You also need to set topology in the CPU. It's good to pin CPUs in the kernel.
2018-03-05 23:57:12	helladen	I pin my 2-3 CPU cores and follow Arch wiki.
2018-03-05 23:57:13	Celmor	I used to do that
2018-03-05 23:57:38	Celmor	but heard that this can cause issues for certain setups, don't recall exactly what
2018-03-05 23:57:40	helladen	I benchmarked my DPC latency and setting it manually is better performance.
2018-03-05 23:58:03	helladen	Virt-Manager by default sets sockets instead of cores.
2018-03-05 23:58:08	helladen	You leave threads at 1.
2018-03-05 23:58:18	helladen	So you have to set cores to 2 if you have 2 CPUs.
2018-03-05 23:58:21	helladen	And rest at 1.
2018-03-05 23:58:30	Celmor	you mean 2 physical cpus?
2018-03-05 23:58:41	helladen	Yeah.
2018-03-05 23:58:53	Celmor	didn't you say you had a 6600K?
2018-03-05 23:59:09	helladen	It has 4 CPUs.
2018-03-05 23:59:10	Celmor	even my 6700k is throttling my VM down
2018-03-05 23:59:22	helladen	Yours has 8.
2018-03-05 23:59:22	Celmor	logical CPUs you mean then
2018-03-05 23:59:43	Celmor	<topology sockets='1' cores='4' threads='2'/>
2018-03-05 23:59:47	helladen	Threads 1.
2018-03-05 23:59:51	Celmor	why?
2018-03-05 23:59:57	helladen	Hyperthreading doesn't work in the emulator very well. :/
2018-03-06 00:00:14	helladen	You can benchmark it for yourself to see the results.
2018-03-06 00:00:22	helladen	Download LatencyMon.
2018-03-06 00:00:28	helladen	Latency is more important than speed.
2018-03-06 00:01:04	Celmor	just thought that when the host has a hyperthreaded cpu the guest should as well, as there are each 2 threads on a logical CPU that should correspond to each other
2018-03-06 00:01:08	Mart|n	can i rename a user

2018-03-06 00:02:01	Celmor	-l
2018-03-06 00:02:03	helladen	It may work not sure 100%. I just noticed DPC latency which is stuttering and lag, happens more if you have more than 1 thread.
2018-03-06 00:02:18	helladen	The emulator may do it automatically by itself.
2018-03-06 00:02:24	helladen	Without needing to specify threads.

2018-03-06 00:04:53	helladen	It's also good to passthrough a secondary Wifi/Ethernet PCI device to reduce the lag.
2018-03-06 00:05:19	helladen	and use MSI interrupts.

2018-03-06 00:06:01	helladen	My motherboard has 2.
2018-03-06 00:06:07	helladen	That's why I bought one with 2.
2018-03-06 00:06:18	Celmor	but that still doesn't connect them together
2018-03-06 00:06:27	helladen	But I use Wifi card on Linux and ethernet on Windows, because I game on Windows and WiFI is fine for basic tasks.
2018-03-06 00:06:34	helladen	What do you mean?
2018-03-06 00:06:51	Celmor	fi you use your router as a switch then
2018-03-06 00:07:05	Celmor	so*
2018-03-06 00:07:08	helladen	I just passthrough the PCI device to the guest.
2018-03-06 00:07:15	helladen	I use virt-manager.
2018-03-06 00:07:46	Celmor	ik, I mean if the VM uses your ethernet device to network to internet, how does it send packets to the host
2018-03-06 00:07:47	helladen	Your ethernet has groups which can be passed through like a GPU.
2018-03-06 00:07:55	Celmor	groups?
2018-03-06 00:07:57	helladen	Oh.
2018-03-06 00:08:20	helladen	Basic networking, it's all on the same network.
2018-03-06 00:08:31	helladen	So it sends the packets using the router the same way, no difference.
2018-03-06 00:08:31	Celmor	yeah, that's what I meant by using the router as a switch
2018-03-06 00:08:49	Celmor	and how did you set up storage?
2018-03-06 00:09:19	Celmor	or just post your domain xml, should explain most
2018-03-06 00:10:16	pankaj	If I turn on wifi after starting my OS then it does not connet to wifi. What is the short command to restart wifi interface to start listening to network?
2018-03-06 00:11:37	Celmor	you probably just need to dell dhcp to retry to connect
2018-03-06 00:11:41	Celmor	tell*
2018-03-06 00:11:58	Celmor	or what do you mean by "listening"

2018-03-06 00:12:36	pankaj	Celmor: So, just restarting 'dhcp' service?
2018-03-06 00:12:41	Celmor	`ip link set down wlan0 && ip link set up wlan0`?
2018-03-06 00:12:46	Celmor	yeah that's what I mean
2018-03-06 00:13:06	Celmor	or just `dhcpcd wlan0`
2018-03-06 00:14:16	helladen	Sorry.

2018-03-06 00:14:50	helladen	I use virtio for the disk driver.
2018-03-06 00:14:54	helladen	Performance is near native.
2018-03-06 00:15:04	helladen	Plus it keeps viruses from injecting code into Linux.
2018-03-06 00:15:04	Celmor	always had problems with virtio storage driver
2018-03-06 00:15:18	helladen	You have to install the Cinnamon Guest Tools.

2018-03-06 00:16:11	helladen	Most VM tech is thanks to Fedora. :P
2018-03-06 00:16:13	Celmor	i know, they are different from each other though

2018-03-06 00:34:04	helladen	I didn't touch my BIOS or anything and it just suddenly started happening.
2018-03-06 00:34:49	helladen	The problem is it works, until I PCI passthrough a GPU.

2018-03-06 01:31:29	chowbok	I just set up Arch on this mini PC with a VGA and an HDMI port. The VGA works fine but I can't get any output on the HDMI. Not sure what to check.
2018-03-06 01:32:44	chowbok	Any boot options I should try? It's Intel video
2018-03-06 01:32:46	occultus	did you try doing both at once or just one at a time? what software do you use to choose which screens are active (desktop environment, arandr, xrandr, etc.)?
2018-03-06 01:34:01	chowbok	This is only console. I haven't even installed X yet. I tried both at once and one at a time. VGA works all the time, HDMI works none of the time. There's only one monitor, it has both inputs.
2018-03-06 01:35:05	occultus	probably can't test both at once in any meaningful way with only one monitor
2018-03-06 01:35:29	occultus	are the VGA/HDMI both on the integrated graphics then?
2018-03-06 01:36:16	chowbok	I believe so.
2018-03-06 01:36:40	occultus	the only thing I actually know how to check with is xrandr
2018-03-06 01:37:28	occultus	outside of X usually you just get duplicated output on all video ports, but X is more flexible and you might be able to see if HDMI shows up as a video output
2018-03-06 01:37:30	chowbok	Can I do xrandr from console?
2018-03-06 01:38:21	occultus	it'll just say it can't open the display
2018-03-06 01:38:53	chowbok	Ah
2018-03-06 01:39:07	occultus	is your goal to use HDMI at the console?
2018-03-06 01:39:13	chowbok	Yeah
2018-03-06 01:39:29	Mart|n	have u tried with monitor on and hdmi only plugged in before turning on
2018-03-06 01:39:31	occultus	yeah i guess i can think of a lot of reasons to want that to work
2018-03-06 01:39:37	chowbok	Mosst of the time it'll be headless
2018-03-06 01:39:54	chowbok	But I don't want to depend on having a VGA monitor handy

2018-03-06 03:08:06	bachler	Has there been any changes to stuff affecting how the clipboard works lately, I am on xfce4, tmux and zsh. It seems something is not as it used to be, when i shift-select text in the terminal i can't paste it with Shift-Ins anymore. What can affect this?
2018-03-06 03:13:27	⚡	seth_ is now known as Helladen
2018-03-06 03:14:28	quite	bachler: maybe just try disable mouse mode in tmux `set -g mouse off`. 
2018-03-06 03:14:36	quite	might not be related but..
2018-03-06 03:15:07	quite	shift-select does override it, but for me sometimes not, I think :)
2018-03-06 03:15:09	▷	quite vague
2018-03-06 03:18:02	bachler	Yeah. I really want to be able to scroll panes with the scrollwheel and alwo select panes with the mouse. Hmm. Maybe something has changed in my setup. I have the same symptoms on my debian box at work as well
2018-03-06 03:18:31	bachler	What settings affevt how the mouse select to clipboard stuff works?
2018-03-06 03:24:41	grawity	your terminal
2018-03-06 03:25:20	grawity	in other apps it's toolkit-dependent, but terminals usually do their own thing
2018-03-06 03:25:26	grawity	also, X11 vs Wayland
2018-03-06 03:25:47	grawity	there's AFAIK no direct alternative to "primary selection" in Wayland
2018-03-06 03:25:57	grawity	(you're not using the clipboard here – you're using primary)
2018-03-06 03:26:15	mitch0	erm, with shift-ins?
2018-03-06 03:26:38	mitch0	shift-ins works on the clipboard imo
2018-03-06 03:26:54	grawity	shift-ins varies in Linux
2018-03-06 03:27:11	grawity	you'll find that some apps use it to paste from clipboard, others paste from primary, and yet others paste from cut_buffers
2018-03-06 03:27:27	grawity	but most terminals paste from primary
2018-03-06 03:28:50	heftig	grawity: there is the gtk_primary_selection protocol
2018-03-06 03:29:31	grawity	heftig: do you happen to know how to make UTF-8 locales available to flatpak apps?
2018-03-06 03:29:40	heftig	what do you mean?
2018-03-06 03:30:56	grawity	so I thought I'd try flatpak, ran `flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Aisleriot` (just a basic app to see if my laptop can handle it), `flatpak run org.gnome.Aisleriot`, says "Non UTF-8 locale (ANSI_X3.4-1968) is not supported"
2018-03-06 03:31:12	heftig	uh
2018-03-06 03:31:15	grawity	if I run it with --command=/bin/sh and check `locale -a` inside, it shows a bunch of en_?? locales, but none of them .UTF-8
2018-03-06 03:31:21	grawity	did I miss some important step
2018-03-06 03:32:06	heftig	it's utf8 for me
2018-03-06 03:32:31	heftig	grawity: what's your locale outside of flatpak?
2018-03-06 03:33:25	grawity	mostly en_US.UTF-8 https://ptpb.pw/KN-2.txt
2018-03-06 03:33:48	grawity	(whatever it is, it affects my home PC as well, not just this one)
2018-03-06 03:35:07	heftig	hm, i can't reproduce, even with an otherwise empty env
2018-03-06 03:38:22	heftig	grawity: oh nvm, i can reproduce
2018-03-06 03:38:30	heftig	but the charmap stays utf-8 for me
2018-03-06 03:38:59	grawity	hmm, didn't check charmap inside
2018-03-06 03:39:22	grawity	though if several apps didn't like it, then...
2018-03-06 03:42:40	grawity	ahh, I see, although the built locales are fine, it doesn't bother updating $LANG for some reason
2018-03-06 03:42:48	szt	Hello, so I have an external backup drive which has a LUKS container on it. And yesterday I started my rsync backup to that drive and at some point it starts hanging giving me this kernel output on the journal https://paste.pound-python.org/show/G0e8fHn0OkwWePpFO3Pn/

2018-03-06 03:43:03	grawity	heftig: so it seems my $LANG and $LC_* inside the container still point to host locales (en_US.UTF-8 etc.) which don't exist

2018-03-06 04:03:20	ulteq	But after I replaced my internal harddrive with a bigger one (same data on it). The incremental backup now took hours.

2018-03-06 04:03:23	snowkrash	i want to post install grub from my arch installation, is that possible?
2018-03-06 04:03:39	ulteq	I understand that rsync does not copy data with the same timestamp and size.
2018-03-06 04:03:51	ulteq	And I think it did not copy anything, but it still took hours?
2018-03-06 04:04:02	snowkrash	do i have to install grub with pacman and then install with grub-install grub on the bootloader partition?

2018-03-06 04:05:29	Windfisch	is it a different filesystem than befote? (althouhh this should only matter for FAT)
2018-03-06 04:06:15	Windfisch	(FAT, for example, has limited timestamp precision, which efrectively changes your timestamps by rounding)

2018-03-06 04:06:57	Windfisch	hum, you said "a few seconds", how many files are that?
2018-03-06 04:08:00	Windfisch	if it's a lot of small files, this should take quite some time on a rotating harddisk, only to query the metadata. maybe the metadata was already cached before, but then you have moved your data, rebooted and flushed the cache by doing so
2018-03-06 04:08:43	snowkrash	Mart|n: thanks i will figure out the rest, just wanted to know if i can do it directly from the distro

2018-03-06 11:26:20	anaeijon	BrainDamage: but mesamatrix shows (for AMD) only r600 and radeonsi
2018-03-06 11:26:20	earnestly	anaeijon: Unless there's a tool which basically attempts to use different profiles until it fails, something I don't know of existing, then there's no easy way to determine what version you support
2018-03-06 11:26:23	anyone	ilmostro: I mean, I use this quassel core connection so I can see what happens when my laptop is disconnected from the internet, and depending, I might also use it on my smartphone
2018-03-06 11:26:37	anyone	I did see the whole coversation, yes. :)
2018-03-06 11:26:58	BrainDamage	anaeijon: r600 is the internal driver name, not the arch
2018-03-06 11:27:05	anyone	(Kind of amusing that matrix simply ignores anything Zuu says, possibly trying to protect me :D)
2018-03-06 11:27:16	ilmostro	anyone: :thumbs: :)
2018-03-06 11:27:24	ilmostro	anyone: 👍 :)
2018-03-06 11:27:28	BrainDamage	anaeijon: as in, legacy devices should be supported by the r600 driver
2018-03-06 11:27:39	earnestly	Or hm
2018-03-06 11:27:44	earnestly	glxinfo might actually be doing this
2018-03-06 11:27:56	BrainDamage	'max core profile' ?

2018-03-06 11:29:07	earnestly	BrainDamage: Don't think so
2018-03-06 11:30:17	⚡	_chaky_ is now known as chaky
2018-03-06 11:30:29	BrainDamage	max core profile does correctly report 4.5 for my card: https://ptpb.pw/d9nE
2018-03-06 11:30:56	BrainDamage	also core profile under opengl
2018-03-06 11:31:59	earnestly	BrainDamage: Hm, probably then
2018-03-06 11:32:35	earnestly	It gets confusing because now you have to consider eglinfo as well which is more portable than just glx, obviously, but doesn't produce as much information and certainly no versions outside of es or es2
2018-03-06 11:33:37	earnestly	BrainDamage: Okay, can confirm that the core profile strings are correct in this case.  The function attempts to set the core profile until it fails.  It sets the GLX_CONTEXT_CORE_PROFILE_BIT_ARB as a result
2018-03-06 11:34:27	earnestly	anaeijon: So there you go.  glxinfo can at least produce the opengl version supported (under glx) if you look at the core profiles it lists
2018-03-06 11:36:29	anaeijon	https://ptpb.pw/9R_t
2018-03-06 11:37:01	anaeijon	thx @BrainDamage and earnestly
2018-03-06 11:37:26	th0rne	What was a command to get video resolution from cli? Was there some ffmpeg info thing?
2018-03-06 11:37:38	anaeijon	but I still don't know how to get OpenGL > 4.0
2018-03-06 11:37:49	BrainDamage	th0rne: xrandr?
2018-03-06 11:37:59	th0rne	Like, video file.
2018-03-06 11:38:08	anaeijon	although it should be supported by the card
2018-03-06 11:38:22	earnestly	anaeijon: You're showing the wrong section, just paste all of glxinfo output
2018-03-06 11:38:27	BrainDamage	th0rne: either mediainfo or ffmpeg -i file
2018-03-06 11:38:34	@grawity	th0rne: ffprobe -hide_banner
2018-03-06 11:38:40	th0rne	Thanks!
2018-03-06 11:39:33	anaeijon	https://ptpb.pw/ozem
2018-03-06 11:42:06	earnestly	anaeijon:  Max core profile version: 3.3
2018-03-06 11:43:07	anaeijon	earnestly: thats what I said at the beginning
2018-03-06 11:43:25	earnestly	anaeijon: But now it's confirmed, with much greater depth
2018-03-06 11:43:34	anaeijon	:(
2018-03-06 11:44:08	anaeijon	so no way to get newer OpenGL although this card should support it?
2018-03-06 11:45:39	BrainDamage	you can force to use a profile even if lacks some extensions, this means you can incur in unexpected behaviour
2018-03-06 11:46:03	BrainDamage	if the program doesn't make use of them, all will be fine, if it does, good luck

2018-03-06 11:52:57	anaeijon	BrainDamage: oh... right, its the enviromental Variable
2018-03-06 11:53:02	melkor	Hello, I have a macbook pro with fedora on it. It has some issues and somebody recommended a package from AUR called linux-macbook. I was curious how I can learn more about this package?
2018-03-06 11:53:17	flipperzz	I am tryin' to connect external mouse and keyboard
2018-03-06 11:53:19	flipperzz	they are not working
2018-03-06 11:53:29	flipperzz	however connecting them to windows laptop is working fine
2018-03-06 11:53:30	flipperzz	:O
2018-03-06 11:53:44	BrainDamage	it's an env var you can use to force a profile even if your card doesn't support it, again, be mindful of my warning, breaking the assumptions means breaking programs
2018-03-06 11:53:46	RetardedOnion	melkor: linux-macbook is a kernel in the aur. seatch linux-macbook on google. the edited files are om the arch aur site
2018-03-06 11:53:52	@grawity	flipperzz: reboot
2018-03-06 11:53:52	flipperzz	restarting archlinux box makes them work but why should I restart my system for it to work!!
2018-03-06 11:53:58	flipperzz	everytime
2018-03-06 11:54:18	flipperzz	thats tiring and makes me feel like I am on garbage OS if I have to keep repeating that
2018-03-06 11:54:52	@grawity	switch to Debian
2018-03-06 11:55:14	Waples_	flipperzz: do you have the propper modules loaded?
2018-03-06 11:55:16	flipperzz	linux sucks. cant even allow me to use basic utilities such as keyboard and mouse without restarting
2018-03-06 11:55:24	BrainDamage	because he likely upgraded the kernel
2018-03-06 11:55:27	flipperzz	Waples_: yes otherwise they wouldnt work after restarting
2018-03-06 11:55:32	flipperzz	BrainDamage: Nope.

2018-03-06 11:55:34	@grawity	yeah if it's the problem I'm guessing
2018-03-06 11:55:44	Tom^	cant be many if any things that does.
2018-03-06 11:56:00	flipperzz	MacGyver: same version bro
2018-03-06 11:56:09	Waples_	why so hostile flipperzz ?
2018-03-06 11:56:17	MacGyver	flipperzz: I'll believe that when I see the output.
2018-03-06 11:56:19	flipperzz	sorry but it pissess me off due to that
2018-03-06 11:56:27	Scimmia	Waples_: because he's a known troll
2018-03-06 11:56:46	MacGyver	Wouldn't be the first time someone in a fit of annoyance missed the difference between a .6 and a .8.

2018-03-06 19:03:36	guys	too busy sulking to connect to IRC :/
2018-03-06 19:05:52	cyberlard	klotz, i bought WIC's bot
2018-03-06 19:06:08	cyberlard	you took too long
2018-03-06 19:06:20	klotz	cyberlard: ah damn you hehe
2018-03-06 19:06:38	klotz	well that's business i guess
2018-03-06 19:06:57	klotz	now i need to find myself another one of those prototypes hehe
2018-03-06 19:35:35	tabsterleir	Any harm to using pkcon to do offline updates in Arch? It seems supported.
2018-03-06 19:37:30	hahuang65	is there any way to get udev rules to trigger while my laptop lid is closed (i guess the system would be in suspend)
2018-03-06 19:37:46	hahuang65	it's kind of annoying to have to open my laptop to connect it to my HDMI monitor when I get to my desk
2018-03-06 19:39:46	ilmostro	hahuang65: what? You know you can disable the suspend-on-lid feature; that way, you can close the lid without suspending laptop
2018-03-06 19:41:19	hahuang65	ilmostro: what if I want to suspend my computer
2018-03-06 19:41:53	ilmostro	I dunno; keyboard shortcut or terminal command
2018-03-06 19:41:56	ilmostro	!shrug
2018-03-06 19:41:56	phrik	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018-03-06 19:42:16	hahuang65	seems like there would be a way to do it
2018-03-06 19:42:30	hahuang65	i don't wnat to have to press a keyboard shortcut everytime I want to close my lid
2018-03-06 19:42:31	ilmostro	hahuang65: you can also set the power button for sleep/suspend
2018-03-06 19:42:44	Ghosthree3	is there a dry run for makepkg? i want to write a pkgbuild and make sure it'll work but dont wish to install it over my working copy if it doesnt
2018-03-06 19:43:14	hahuang65	ilmostro: i guess my question to you is... the exact question I asked... is that not possible?
2018-03-06 19:43:33	hahuang65	i feel like you're suggesting an alternative, which is helpful, but without having answered the original question.
2018-03-06 19:43:52	ilmostro	not from my perspective
2018-03-06 19:44:01	hahuang65	did you answer the original question?
2018-03-06 19:44:22	ilmostro	** regarding "is that not possible?"
2018-03-06 19:44:40	hahuang65	"is there any way to get udev rules to trigger while my laptop lid is closed"
2018-03-06 19:44:51	agregory	Ghosthree3: what? just don't install it
2018-03-06 19:45:17	Ghosthree3	agregory: oh true, i can just leave off -i and it'll run and confirm it can build?
2018-03-06 19:46:09	agregory	yes, makepkg will still build the package without -i...
2018-03-06 19:46:17	guys	hahuang65:  by default makepkg does not overwrite the package file (see --force)
2018-03-06 19:46:24	hahuang65	guys: wrong person
2018-03-06 19:46:32	guys	whoops
2018-03-06 19:46:32	Ghosthree3	agregory: i just hadn't ever done it before so it didn't occur to me
2018-03-06 19:46:35	guys	Ghosthree3: ^^
2018-03-06 19:46:39	guys	also see --noarchive
2018-03-06 19:46:47	Ghosthree3	guys: 'the package files'?
2018-03-06 19:46:54	ilmostro	hahuang65: theoretically, it could be possible to detect hdmi plug-in event; though, I'm not sure
2018-03-06 19:47:00	Ghosthree3	why would makepkg -sri not overwrite the installed package
2018-03-06 19:47:13	guys	--noarchive will build the package but not create the package file
2018-03-06 19:48:00	guys	in other words it runs the build() and package() and creates the "$pkgdir", but does not tar that up
2018-03-06 19:48:07	Ghosthree3	ah
2018-03-06 19:48:08	ilmostro	hahuang65: actually, I take that back; and I'll let others chime in :)
2018-03-06 19:48:45	guys	Ghosthree3: makepkg -sri will say "A package has already been built, installing existing package..."
2018-03-06 19:48:57	hahuang65	ilmostro: your alternative suggestions will definitely be used if there is actually no way to do this. my specific scenario is that i move around alot, and so i don't want to have to press a suspend button. rather just close my laptop lid
2018-03-06 19:49:00	guys	(in the event that you already built the package before)
2018-03-06 19:49:07	hahuang65	then when I get to my desk, it's a pain to have to open the lid to wake it, then plug in hdmi
2018-03-06 19:49:27	hahuang65	if that makes sense... if it's rarely an occurrence, then absolutely... but i have to do this 5 or 6 times
2018-03-06 19:49:51	ilmostro	hahuang65: trust me, I know what you mean; as you can tell, I've thought about this as well in the past :)
2018-03-06 19:50:14	hahuang65	yeah
2018-03-06 19:50:40	ilmostro	the little things add up; that would be an elegant solution, if possible.  
2018-03-06 19:51:28	Ghosthree3	guys: issue is i wrote a pkgbuild to install X then deleted it after, now want to recreate to share without breaking what i have, but i think without -i i should be fine
2018-03-06 19:52:10	aegis	Hey all, I started getting segmentation faults running the same utility app for my radio I have run for years.  Is there something wrong with the new kernel?

2018-03-06 20:26:18	kevr	aegis: a bit more description about the issue would help you here in the future, people need to know "how it began, what was used, what you did, what you have (configs, etc), how it errored out"

2018-03-06 20:31:15	qoh	kevr: worked. apparently sth like the electrical resistance drops and the amplifier then just generates that buzzing sound
2018-03-06 20:31:30	kevr	qoh: sweet
2018-03-06 20:31:48	kevr	thats wild that it would do that on a digital device in this day and age though
2018-03-06 20:32:10	kevr	you'd think firmware writers would consider that
2018-03-06 20:32:28	qoh	kevr: well it's connected analogous but i'm disappointed by the amplifier
2018-03-06 20:32:36	kevr	ah!
2018-03-06 20:35:47	qoh	kevr: upon every shutdown - in the last seconds just before the computer went lights-out - I always used to get the buzzing sound. recently it started even during use. i suppose the defaults for the snd_hda_intel module changed with some update.
2018-03-06 20:43:18	aegis	kevr: It's a tool from the Elecraft website for their ham radio.  The latest version is from June 25, 2016 and it's worked since then.  http://www.elecraft.com/KX3/KX3_software.htm

2018-03-06 20:44:23	kevr	maybe hit up Elecraft about it, with your kernel version

2018-03-06 21:58:40	kevr`	?
2018-03-06 21:58:51	sangy	it does, DNS resolving is still like some misterious figure to me still
2018-03-06 21:58:58	sangy	I know how it works, but do I really tho? 
2018-03-06 21:59:11	kevr`	you do, theres added complexity in the operating system
2018-03-06 21:59:19	sangy	did nscd -K got a 1 as retval
2018-03-06 21:59:30	kevr`	hmmm...

2018-03-06 22:00:23	sangy	ok, I'll let you guys know if this just magicallyh borks
2018-03-06 22:00:26	kevr`	your arp tables might be messed up too
2018-03-06 22:00:36	kevr`	which a reboot would flush cleanly without a doubt
2018-03-06 22:00:52	sangy	btw this is the machine I was running without a CPU fan last week, I pulled it up from the grave and now it has wifis
2018-03-06 22:00:59	kevr`	nice

2018-03-06 22:01:55	BombStrike	JoshDreamland, yep
2018-03-06 22:02:12	BombStrike	there was changes to terminfo
2018-03-06 22:02:28	JoshDreamland	this application would definitely be using that
2018-03-06 22:02:29	BombStrike	try with TERM=xterm
2018-03-06 22:02:38	sangy	I'm back, sadly still no worky

2018-03-06 22:02:45	JoshDreamland	awesome! thanks a million!
2018-03-06 22:03:15	sangy	I'm completely out of ideas, why does it not resolve jesus
2018-03-06 22:03:22	JoshDreamland	as far as I can tell, it's working great, now
2018-03-06 22:03:32	kevr`	sangy: do you have nslookup on your machine?
2018-03-06 22:03:35	bq	jesus is not a valid hostname
2018-03-06 22:03:43	sangy	so here's my new plan. I'll save the ip of my update mirror to etc/hosts/ -Yus and pray
2018-03-06 22:03:47	sangy	kevr`: let me check
2018-03-06 22:03:55	kevr`	sangy: sorry, you can try `hosts: files dns [NOTFOUND=return] ...`
2018-03-06 22:04:03	kevr`	that might be your golden ticket, according to this thread
2018-03-06 22:04:05	sangy	ok, let me try that
2018-03-06 22:04:23	sangy	and I do have nslookup (I tried to tab complete it in weechat now lol :[)
2018-03-06 22:04:29	kevr`	:)
2018-03-06 22:04:56	kevr`	but honestly their !UNAVAIL=return line is probably better
2018-03-06 22:04:59	kevr`	than NOTFOUND

2018-03-06 22:24:04	guys	sangy: yeah, dhcpcd is interesting in that we actually have the upstream dev (who does not use Arch Linux) hanging out on the distro bugtracker looking at bugreports for his software

2018-03-06 22:25:38	sangy	ah of course
2018-03-06 22:25:45	guys	dirmngr is a per-user process, in this case the root user

2018-03-06 22:41:37	sangy	hmm, now I see the problem
2018-03-06 22:41:54	sangy	it's trying to fetch a key for CEB167EFB5722BD6, but I can't seem to find it anywhere
2018-03-06 22:42:02	sangy	not even on this machine or online hkp browsers
2018-03-06 22:42:40	sangy	guys: ^ this is your key right meltdown spectre!?
2018-03-06 22:42:53	kevr`	hmm
2018-03-06 22:42:59	kevr`	dhcpcd works fine for me, i wonder...
2018-03-06 22:43:04	⚡	anyone is now known as meltdown_spectre
2018-03-06 22:43:11	meltdown_spectre	my key is super secret
2018-03-06 22:43:40	guys	sangy: what is your keyserver
2018-03-06 22:43:40	sangy	meltdown_spectre: I can't update because no fetchy the key :[
2018-03-06 22:43:48	sangy	the sks keypool
2018-03-06 22:43:55	guys	it's available on e.g. pgp.mit.edu
2018-03-06 22:44:02	Scimmia	sangy: what's the error, exactly?
2018-03-06 22:44:23	Scimmia	the keyservers all sync, I guarantee it's available in the sks pool
2018-03-06 22:44:31	guys	> but I can't seem to find it anywhere
2018-03-06 22:44:31	sangy	> keyserver receive failed: Server indicated a failure
2018-03-06 22:44:41	Scimmia	yeah, that doesn't mean the key isn't found
2018-03-06 22:44:43	sangy	guys: found it if I don't use tor now
2018-03-06 22:44:48	guys	Well, that is not a "cannot find", that is a "error contacting the keyserver"
2018-03-06 22:44:55	sangy	but that still doesn't explain why no love
2018-03-06 22:44:59	sangy	oh this was in both machines
2018-03-06 22:45:09	kevr`	tor sucks dick
2018-03-06 22:45:15	⚡	dvb_ is now known as dvb
2018-03-06 22:45:19	cd80	kevr`: dhcpcd works for you ? :)
2018-03-06 22:45:20	sangy	I still can't update on one, I could find it on my laptop now
2018-03-06 22:45:20	guys	because the actual data connection between your machine and the keyserver, did not work
2018-03-06 22:45:21	Scimmia	sangy: step 1, use the default keyserver
2018-03-06 22:45:23	guys	because tor
2018-03-06 22:45:29	kevr`	cd80: sec, im testing a bit more
2018-03-06 22:45:35	cd80	kevr`: ok
2018-03-06 22:45:44	sangy	I'm using the default settings on the machine that's not working (i.e., whatever pacman key came up with)
2018-03-06 22:45:45	kevr`	but yes, the latest commit on their github "seems" to work fine
2018-03-06 22:45:47	guys	sangy: also why not just install archlinux-keyring, how out of date is this thing
2018-03-06 22:45:58	sangy	guys: like 8 months
2018-03-06 22:46:07	sangy	and yeah why not just do that let me try
2018-03-06 22:46:21	▷	guys waves at the security guy with an 8-months-out-of-date system
2018-03-06 22:46:32	cd80	kevr`: maybe they fixed it...
2018-03-06 22:46:37	sangy	guys: lol I picked up this thing from the trash
2018-03-06 22:46:42	kevr`	yeah, gonna verify
2018-03-06 22:46:43	kevr`	one sec
2018-03-06 22:46:48	sangy	i'm trying to make it re-live again, this is not what I use every day :P
2018-03-06 22:47:04	guys	sangy: you trashed your own system, or you found it with Arch preinstalled?
2018-03-06 22:47:15	guys	:p
2018-03-06 22:47:31	sangy	it was computer from the trash and an old HDD of mine with arch installed on it :P
2018-03-06 22:47:56	sangy	wow it can't "locally sign" things and IPC connect call failed
2018-03-06 22:47:56	guys	oh well, anyway you will presumably learn more about the packaging toolchain if you want to be a TU
2018-03-06 22:48:00	sangy	this is more bork than I thought
2018-03-06 22:48:11	Scimmia	sangy: date/time correct?
2018-03-06 22:48:12	guys	sangy: wow, do you have a smartcard connected?
2018-03-06 22:48:20	guys	and date/time ^^
2018-03-06 22:48:32	guys	but I got lucky a few times with the smartcard thing
2018-03-06 22:48:43	sangy	guys: I do have a yubikey in, now that you mention
2018-03-06 22:48:47	sangy	and I recall that bug
2018-03-06 22:48:50	▷	guys scores again
2018-03-06 22:49:11	sangy	AAnd the date/time is set to 10th of nov of 2017
2018-03-06 22:49:18	Scimmia	ROFL
2018-03-06 22:49:20	kevr`	cd80: hm, the current dhcpcd in arch repos is working fine for me
2018-03-06 22:49:23	kevr`	hmmm...
2018-03-06 22:49:25	sangy	wow I wonder if it's just better to reinstall the whole thing
2018-03-06 22:49:29	guys	sangy: piling on the errors here...
2018-03-06 22:49:36	Scimmia	sangy: if it's not one thing, it's the other
2018-03-06 22:49:43	cd80	kevr`: 7.0.1-1 ?
2018-03-06 22:49:50	sangy	lessons learned: don't build your machines out of junk
2018-03-06 22:49:52	kevr`	yup
2018-03-06 22:49:56	guys	!grab sangy 
2018-03-06 22:49:56	phrik	guys: Bazinga!
2018-03-06 22:50:00	cd80	kevr`: go figure...
2018-03-06 22:50:05	kevr`	hmmm..
2018-03-06 22:50:16	kevr`	let me test a bit more i guess, maybe its related to ethernet
2018-03-06 22:50:22	cd80	kevr`: for me it times out and looks like its doing ipv6 when I need ipv4
2018-03-06 22:50:46	kevr`	there are two commits related to ipv6 drops
2018-03-06 22:50:58	kevr`	you should build the most recent dhcpcd from github and see if it works for you
2018-03-06 22:51:32	cd80	kevr`: right now I'm just using dhcpcd-6.11.5-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz
2018-03-06 22:52:09	kevr`	could you possibly give it a shot? if it doesn't work, i'm going to look at this code for the next day and try to fix it
2018-03-06 22:52:18	kevr`	otherwise, im not going to spend time on a debugged feature :P
2018-03-06 22:52:36	cd80	kevr`: fair enough ;)
2018-03-06 22:52:46	kevr`	thank you
2018-03-06 22:53:07	coderobe	esph: `lsblk -l | awk '{if($7){print $1}}' | tail -n+2``?
2018-03-06 22:53:32	cd80	kevr`: supposed I could give dhclient a try
2018-03-06 22:53:48	sangy	ok, timedate set and no yubikey, if this doesn't fix the whole thing I'll just reinstall the whole deal
2018-03-06 22:53:57	kevr`	from what ive seen dhclient still works as intended
2018-03-06 22:55:51	esph	coderobe: ah, nice, but that's close to the inverse of what I want
2018-03-06 22:56:02	coderobe	esph: more like `lsblk -nl | awk '{if($7){print substr($1, 1, length($1)-1)}}' | uniq` ?
2018-03-06 22:56:06	occultus	systemd 238 crashes on startup (says it dumped core and ABRT), how can I debug this? I tried invoking it via init=/bin/sh and passing a few different combinations of options to systemd, but it always says it dumped a core but I can't find a core anywhere
2018-03-06 22:56:17	coderobe	which is only gonna show the devices, assuming standard naming
2018-03-06 22:56:24	sangy	wew it works
2018-03-06 22:56:30	sangy	wow a shadow.pacnew that's interesting
2018-03-06 22:56:50	esph	coderobe: okay, haha, now that's perfectly the inverse
2018-03-06 22:57:00	esph	I really need to get around to learning awk
2018-03-06 22:57:02	coderobe	huh
2018-03-06 22:57:20	coderobe	so you want everything that's not mounted?
2018-03-06 22:57:37	esph	Everything base device that has *no* mounted partitions
2018-03-06 22:57:42	kevr`	cd80: does your router have ipv6 enabled?
2018-03-06 22:57:46	kevr`	even if it doesn't hand out ips
2018-03-06 22:57:49	coderobe	esph: give me 2 minutes
2018-03-06 22:58:09	cd80	kevr`: no ipv6 is disabled
2018-03-06 22:58:12	kevr`	k
2018-03-06 22:59:31	PhazonicRidley	um ok, is there a way to make powertop and powerdevil work together?
2018-03-06 22:59:43	coderobe	esph: `lsblk -nl | awk '{if(!$7){if($1 ~ /[0-9]$/){print substr($1, 1, length($1)-1)}else{print $1}}}' | uniq`
2018-03-06 22:59:49	esph	coderobe: `lsblk -rno PKNAME,MOUNTPOINT` might simplify your awk some
2018-03-06 23:00:16	cd80	kevr`: the interface I use dhcpcd on is the one facing the internet
2018-03-06 23:00:33	kevr`	ok, i see
2018-03-06 23:01:24	esph	coderobe: that gets my device with mounted partitions as well
2018-03-06 23:01:53	coderobe	oh you're right
2018-03-06 23:01:55	coderobe	one moment
2018-03-06 23:02:21	esph	the output with -rno PKNAME,MOUNTPOINT is very simple
2018-03-06 23:02:29	esph	Think it provides all the necessary info
2018-03-06 23:16:36	kevr`	cd80: are you compiling dhcpcd?

2018-03-06 23:35:17	occultus	or is is herbsluftwm
2018-03-06 23:35:27	Irishluck83	first one

2018-03-06 23:35:58	phrik	sangy: community/herbstluftwm
2018-03-06 23:35:58	occultus	attempting to debug systemd only caused me more issues and sadness so I'll just file a bug with the few details I have
2018-03-06 23:36:03	sangy	wew, Irishluck83 thanks!
2018-03-06 23:36:11	Irishluck83	i love herbstluftwm
2018-03-06 23:36:11	kevr`	guten nacht
2018-03-06 23:37:32	Irishluck83	ah ya guten nacht
2018-03-06 23:38:43	sangy	Irishluck83: ok what am I looking at
2018-03-06 23:38:50	sangy	I see gray
2018-03-06 23:39:16	Irishluck83	you are in a container. if you do alt+enter should bring up a terminal
2018-03-06 23:39:46	Irishluck83	if you do mod(alt)+u it will split down and +o will split right
2018-03-06 23:39:56	sangy	no terminal
2018-03-06 23:40:17	Irishluck83	let me look at the default config..hang on
2018-03-06 23:40:19	esph	coderobe: I'm sure this would be nicer if I actually new awk, but I got one working: `lsblk -rno PKNAME | grep -vf <(lsblk -rno PKNAME,MOUNTPOINT | awk '{if($2){print $1}}' | sort | uniq ) -ve '^$' | sort | uniq`
2018-03-06 23:41:26	Irishluck83	sangy: i think xterm is the default terminal. you can have the config look at whatever one you want
2018-03-06 23:41:47	sangy	ah I probs don't have xterm
2018-03-06 23:41:54	Irishluck83	the default configs are located at /etc/xdg/herbstluftwm/
2018-03-06 23:42:03	kevr`	what a name..
2018-03-06 23:42:17	Irishluck83	you can copy the panel.sh and autostart to the .config/herbstluftwm/
2018-03-06 23:42:25	kevr`	autumn air wm
2018-03-06 23:42:27	kevr`	interesting
2018-03-06 23:42:43	Irishluck83	yep
2018-03-06 23:42:46	sangy	kevr`: Ikr? cue me trying to write that in my .xinitrc and wondering why it didn't work
2018-03-06 23:42:56	Irishluck83	not too many people run it. their irc channel is dead
2018-03-06 23:42:56	kevr`	lol
2018-03-06 23:45:08	sangy	I think on this machinie that I brought from the grave I'll have to use point-and-click things because no time to spend like I do on my laptop
2018-03-06 23:45:32	beest	i didn't even know it was still a thing
2018-03-06 23:45:47	beest	i've literally known no one in years who actually uses it
2018-03-06 23:45:58	sangy	herblustrwms?
2018-03-06 23:46:02	Irishluck83	what? herb?
2018-03-06 23:46:05	beest	yes
2018-03-06 23:46:24	Irishluck83	ive used it on and off for two years now
2018-03-06 23:46:48	Irishluck83	i go between xmonad,i3, and herbstluftwm
2018-03-06 23:47:02	beest	i didn't know anyone used xmonad anymore either :D
2018-03-06 23:47:23	Irishluck83	:)
2018-03-06 23:47:34	sangy	wew, kernel panic
2018-03-06 23:47:44	sangy	don't panic, my dear kernel
2018-03-06 23:47:52	Irishluck83	well i've ran into a few weird things with xmonad and qutebrowser
2018-03-06 23:47:53	coderobe	esph: good one. i've made it a bit shorter - `lsblk -no PKNAME|grep -vf<(lsblk -no PKNAME,MOUNTPOINT|awk '{if($2){print$1}}'|sort -u) -e'^$'|sort -u`
2018-03-06 23:48:04	kevr`	you use xmonad and qute?
2018-03-06 23:48:05	kevr`	man...
2018-03-06 23:48:06	beest	why would xmonad not like qute
2018-03-06 23:48:09	kevr`	you're like me 5 years ago
2018-03-06 23:48:19	kevr`	...i'm irish too
2018-03-06 23:48:23	Irishluck83	nice
2018-03-06 23:48:42	Irishluck83	i've finally gotten off xmonad though. 
2018-03-06 23:48:58	beest	i'm irish too, let's riot
2018-03-06 23:49:14	kevr`	\o/
2018-03-06 23:49:54	Irishluck83	nah...go and have a pint
2018-03-06 23:50:27	kevr`	Been doing that for about 8 hours now
2018-03-06 23:50:53	Irishluck83	what u use now kevr` ? you said u used xmonad about 5 years ago
2018-03-06 23:51:02	esph	coderobe: I've known about sort -u forever, but is it actually better than sort | uniq ? Or are they pretty similar?
2018-03-06 23:51:08	kevr`	i'm using gnome right now, but my primary choice would be i3
2018-03-06 23:51:32	coderobe	esph: you save at least one fork and the pipe
2018-03-06 23:51:35	Irishluck83	that is the one wm i can't get off of. i always come back to it
2018-03-06 23:51:40	Irishluck83	like arch
2018-03-06 23:51:48	kevr`	;:P
2018-03-06 23:52:17	kevr`	however, i like xmonad a lot more than anything else, but i can't get over some of the bugs ive experienced with xmonad
2018-03-06 23:52:21	kevr`	that are not going to be fixed
2018-03-06 23:52:47	beest	i had a brief flirtation with bspwm, it's nice but i just couldn't bend it to my workflow and drifted back to i3
2018-03-06 23:53:29	Irishluck83	same here
2018-03-06 23:53:36	beest	however i started using polybar about the same time and carried it with me when i went back to i3
2018-03-06 23:53:50	Irishluck83	ive tried most big named wm
2018-03-06 23:53:59	Irishluck83	i3 is still one of the better ones
2018-03-06 23:54:20	kevr`	afk for a bit-
2018-03-06 23:55:21	occultus	apparently the wrong set of kernel config flags can cause systemd to SIGABRT on startup. yipee
2018-03-06 23:56:29	beest	someone used to maintain a set of kernel flags necessary for systemd as shipped on arch
2018-03-06 23:56:48	beest	probably on the wiki somewheres
2018-03-06 23:57:51	beest	i haven't looked at it lately, stopped rolling my own kernels a fair while ago
2018-03-06 23:57:56	kevr`	?
2018-03-06 23:58:01	kevr`	which kernel flags?
2018-03-07 00:00:21	occultus	i have 607 flags different from arch's
2018-03-07 00:00:27	kevr`	god damn
2018-03-07 00:00:43	occultus	so it could be any of those, but probably something with cgroups since that appears to be when it crashes
2018-03-07 00:01:14	badpixel	hi, i have https://ptpb.pw/7GY- on gparted. i follow this steps https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-3 but when try to mount root/ i have: mount: /home/badpixel/archarm64/root: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/mmcblk0p2, missing codepage or helper program, or other error. gparted said possible e2fsprogs missing but i have that. i try fsck -y /dev/mmcblk0p2. here

2018-03-07 00:01:32	kevr`	badpixel: this isn't the proper channel
2018-03-07 00:01:44	badpixel	is an erro when mount

2018-03-07 00:04:52	occultus	hmm, maybe I counted wrong, maybe it's thousands of config options that I have that are different
2018-03-07 00:04:55	coderobe	very much an alarm problem.

2018-03-07 00:14:07	guys	coderobe, occultus: I'm super confused, I don't even know awk and already I discovered awk has an if (!$2)
2018-03-07 00:14:56	coderobe	guys: ?
2018-03-07 00:15:15	guys	lsblk -no PKNAME,MOUNTPOINT | awk '{if( $1 && !$2){print$1}}' | sort -u
2018-03-07 00:15:28	coderobe	guys: doesn't work.
2018-03-07 00:16:01	guys	seems to work for me, though I don't have any unmounted partitions ATM
2018-03-07 00:16:13	guys	coding-wise it seems to fit the bill
2018-03-07 00:16:27	coderobe	"sda" might have a mixed amount of mounted/non mounted partitions
2018-03-07 00:16:37	coderobe	so you end up with sda in your output even if only one of them is unmounted
2018-03-07 00:16:45	guys	is that bad?
2018-03-07 00:16:55	coderobe	that's not what esph wanted
2018-03-07 00:16:57	occultus	guys: why am i part of this conversation?
2018-03-07 00:17:24	guys	uh, not sure
2018-03-07 00:17:45	guys	I just noticed this in scrollback and confused the color of your nick
2018-03-07 00:17:49	coderobe	guys: the goal is to know the devices with no mounted partitions
2018-03-07 00:17:50	occultus	oh
2018-03-07 00:18:05	esph	guys: yeah, that will still print devices with mounted partitions

2018-03-07 02:39:00	IamTrying	Any knowledgeable person here? 0) Preparing a motherboard with 6GPU 1) Which open-source mining frameworks out there? (web managed like Antminer) 
2018-03-07 02:44:06	[codemonkey]	How can one see what pacman -Ru will remove without it actually running? I couldn't find anything in the man page that would to it.
2018-03-07 02:44:16	esph	IamTrying: pretty sure freenode has dedicated mining channels
2018-03-07 02:45:28	IamTrying	esph: it was specific ArchLinux (not all mining people using Arch instead CentOS/Ubuntu). Never mind i will write it myself not so hard.
2018-03-07 02:45:30	[codemonkey]	It does, such as ##altcoins and #ethereum-mining
2018-03-07 02:46:25	esph	IamTrying: I just haven't seen people talking about mining setups in here ever, so thought you might get a better response in one of those places.
2018-03-07 02:46:40	IamTrying	Thanks
2018-03-07 02:47:14	esph	Well, at least no questions specific to mining
2018-03-07 02:49:13	[codemonkey]	<IamTrying> No i am making Antiminer competitor hardware myself. I have motherboard and GPU's
2018-03-07 02:49:21	[codemonkey]	<IamTrying> i am trying to make a open-source hardware and software for mining 
2018-03-07 02:49:25	[codemonkey]	at least he was polite.
2018-03-07 02:49:50	kevr`	:-)
2018-03-07 02:51:50	sQVe	How do I keep the terminal open when running a command like 'urxvt -e ls'?
2018-03-07 02:52:04	sQVe	I'm probably missing something really obvious...
2018-03-07 02:52:19	Mart|n	 & at end
2018-03-07 02:52:43	[codemonkey]	aha, -p

2018-03-07 02:53:27	BrainDamage	you don't want &, you want a command that doesn't return
2018-03-07 02:53:41	BrainDamage	& does the opposite, it detaches the command
2018-03-07 02:53:54	sQVe	It works when I run apps like vim etc.
2018-03-07 02:54:01	kevr`	!kill Mart|n
2018-03-07 02:54:01	▷	phrik Eh?
2018-03-07 02:54:02	BrainDamage	because vim doesn't return
2018-03-07 02:54:06	sQVe	But I want to spawn a new terminal for simple commands too
2018-03-07 02:54:13	sQVe	BrainDamage: Yeah. Correct.
2018-03-07 02:54:20	[codemonkey]	just run urxvt
2018-03-07 02:54:20	Mart|n	!kill "kevr" like that
2018-03-07 02:54:20	▷	phrik beats kevr like that with a 440BX motherboard until they slump to the ground.
2018-03-07 02:54:25	[codemonkey]	then when it's open type ls
2018-03-07 02:54:31	[codemonkey]	?
2018-03-07 02:54:33	▷	kevr` slumps to the ground
2018-03-07 02:54:50	BrainDamage	sQVe: pipe the output in less?
2018-03-07 02:55:16	sQVe	[codemonkey]: I work with loads of different terminal and this would simplify my workflow somewhat.
2018-03-07 02:55:17	⚡	kevr` is now known as kevr
2018-03-07 02:55:20	BrainDamage	then until you quit less, the command won't return, and therefore the terminal
2018-03-07 02:55:34	sQVe	I want to be able to spawn multiple terminals from one terminalö
2018-03-07 02:55:50	BrainDamage	urxvt -e 'ls | less'
2018-03-07 02:56:14	sQVe	BrainDamage: Yeah. That's not really what I want sadly
2018-03-07 02:56:30	kevr	so you just wanna be able to launch a shitload of urxvts?
2018-03-07 02:56:38	sQVe	But maybe I'm looking for something thats impossible.
2018-03-07 02:56:44	jusss	is there another way to login the system? I mean not password, if there's a patter like android?
2018-03-07 02:57:25	sQVe	kevr: Well. Not a shitload but I want to launch multiple urxvts with a command with the same pwd.
2018-03-07 02:57:34	sQVe	as the terminal executing the command
2018-03-07 02:57:37	kevr	with a command... with the same pwd?
2018-03-07 02:57:44	kevr	okay
2018-03-07 02:57:58	kevr	i feel like braindamage is what you want but you need to pass in extra logic
2018-03-07 02:58:01	kevr	for your directory
2018-03-07 02:58:07	[codemonkey]	sQVe could you explain from the start what you're trying to do?
2018-03-07 02:58:08	kevr	BrainDamage's solution, that is
2018-03-07 02:58:30	kevr	because then you just launch up a ton of those in the background
2018-03-07 02:58:32	▷	Mart|n sits back and sips coffee 
2018-03-07 02:58:37	kevr	you know what i mean?
2018-03-07 02:58:43	kcseb	Heya' so I have yet another issue :c
2018-03-07 02:58:57	kcseb	Whenever I reboot my laptop, I have to CD back into broadcom-wl and build the package. 
2018-03-07 02:58:59	BrainDamage	sQVe: you could also launch an interactive shell
2018-03-07 02:59:04	kevr	maybe pass in $PWD or something
2018-03-07 02:59:10	BrainDamage	and have the interactive shell execute your command
2018-03-07 02:59:11	sQVe	This is the base script I've put together so far: https://gist.github.com/cc92a5095f9c12d24b67a4082a9a9795

2018-03-07 02:59:18	[codemonkey]	Are you trying to get a bunch of terminals to open, each running a different command, and have them not close on completion?  If so I think BrainDamage pipe to less option will do that.
2018-03-07 02:59:19	kevr	ooh, that sounds even better
2018-03-07 02:59:21	speak	Hmm, any ideas on where to start debugging this problem: Getting something that sounds like buffer underruns for audio when I watch videos or listen to audio on Chromium
2018-03-07 02:59:41	BrainDamage	sQVe: the interactive shell won't close until you exit it
2018-03-07 02:59:48	speak	mpv plays videos & audio just fine
2018-03-07 03:00:05	kevr	speak: are they webm?
2018-03-07 03:00:16	sQVe	BrainDamage: Hmm allright.
2018-03-07 03:00:17	speak	Happens on soundcloud as well, so I imagine not
2018-03-07 03:00:23	kevr	ah
2018-03-07 03:02:10	[codemonkey]	kcseb can you not just install the package from aur?
2018-03-07 03:03:49	kcseb	[codemonkey]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/broadcom-wl/
2018-03-07 03:03:49	phrik	Title: AUR (en) - broadcom-wl (at aur.archlinux.org)
2018-03-07 03:03:59	kcseb	I cloned that, and ran makepkg -csir and it installs. 
2018-03-07 03:04:05	kcseb	Then, I reboot, and my WiFi is gone again
2018-03-07 03:04:13	[codemonkey]	you need to install it
2018-03-07 03:04:18	[codemonkey]	or does sir doe that?
2018-03-07 03:04:42	[codemonkey]	my bad, it does
2018-03-07 03:04:50	kevr	does it install a kernel module?
2018-03-07 03:04:51	sQVe	BrainDamage: I found the solution. `urxvt -e sh -c "ls; zsh"` works like a charm!
2018-03-07 03:05:07	BrainDamage	sQVe: that's pretty ugly
2018-03-07 03:05:20	BrainDamage	launch the base shell in interactive mode instead
2018-03-07 03:05:32	sQVe	BrainDamage: How do I do that?
2018-03-07 03:05:58	BrainDamage	depends on your shell, since i assume it's zsh, use -i
2018-03-07 03:06:24	[codemonkey]	kcseb what does the r option do? Is it just removing dependenciess that were needed for the install?
2018-03-07 03:07:33	Abhi18022	hey all

2018-03-07 03:11:02	mpan	You do not have any reason to contact a maintainer directly (if you have, please state it).
2018-03-07 03:11:18	Abhi18022	but application is working well but need littel bit of costumization

2018-03-07 03:13:11	kevr	but you are installing alarm
2018-03-07 03:13:13	kevr	not arch linux
2018-03-07 03:13:14	Abhi18022	will be quite difficult

2018-03-07 03:13:46	badpixel	i cant install archarm if cant mount 
2018-03-07 03:13:53	badpixel	stop being asshole pls
2018-03-07 03:14:07	mpan	Abhi18022: this is not maintainer’s job to provide you with either private services or technical support. Their job is to provide packages. If you need *help* (assuming your own input!), IRC, mailing lists or forum are for that. Assuming this has anything to do with Arch Linux and not upstream.
2018-03-07 03:14:11	kevr	it doesn't change the fact that you can ask them, i don't get why you're not
2018-03-07 03:14:23	badpixel	idgf
2018-03-07 03:14:27	kevr	alright

2018-03-07 03:15:30	mpan	Abhi18022: **IF** this has anything to do with Arch Linux, you may start a bug report as a Feature Requet, of course. But, of course, under that assumption.
2018-03-07 03:15:43	Abhi18022	mpan if i do get the source code of the application i can coustumize it muy self 
2018-03-07 03:15:44	badpixel	no. this is a problem with my arch i cant mount a sd card. that is. im try dif card and i have the same.
2018-03-07 03:16:01	Abhi18022	lol nice idea let me see if it's on github 
2018-03-07 03:16:01	epicmetal	Didn't ~/.bash_profile used to be sourced for a GNOME/Xorg session?
2018-03-07 03:16:18	mpan	Abhi18022: well… sure, you can customize the source code yourself. This is what the license tells you.
2018-03-07 03:16:20	Mart|n	ok make sure u use correct partition and format partition ...not just the device
2018-03-07 03:16:26	epicmetal	(GDM -> GNOME/Xorg)
2018-03-07 03:16:39	epicmetal	I'm finding that it isn't being read anymore
2018-03-07 03:16:51	badpixel	Mart|n: im sure. i have pasted all logs before
2018-03-07 03:17:12	badpixel	can i paste it again? all question?

2018-03-07 03:19:45	Abhi18022	[codemonkey]: thanks but i am not skilled enough to csotumize it my self i just need a littel bit of dev so let's see if i can contact him 
2018-03-07 03:19:50	mpan	MrElendig: unfortunately some projects still use it. But this is -offtopic now.

2018-03-07 03:20:17	MrElendig	except when you can't get the source because it going down constantly :p
2018-03-07 03:20:21	[codemonkey]	You did a review of the code that quickly?
2018-03-07 03:20:38	Abhi18022	the costumization can be helpfull for everyone and will make that a better appication 
2018-03-07 03:21:03	[codemonkey]	Sounds like a feature request, maybe there's a way to submit one on sourceforge?
2018-03-07 03:21:20	badpixel	MacGyver: gparted said possible e2fsprogs missing but i have that. i try fsck -y /dev/mmcblk0p2. here is the output https://ptpb.pw/2_ia 
2018-03-07 03:21:31	[codemonkey]	There's a klvaro forum right there

2018-03-07 03:21:47	MacGyver	badpixel: Did you check whether the kernel you're running is the same version as the kernel installed?
2018-03-07 03:21:51	Abhi18022	it's not about source code 
2018-03-07 03:21:58	mpan	Abhi18022: but this has nothing to do with guys, who build that package for Arch. And no, they will not provate you private consulting, especially for free (but I doubt most of them would do even for money).
2018-03-07 03:22:12	MacGyver	badpixel: I assume this is not the problem, but it *might* be so I'd like to be sure.
2018-03-07 03:22:54	mpan	Abhi18022: this seems like a thing for the authors of the software (not related to Arch). Contact them. But you have not much higher chances of solving *your* problems and having the same ideas as you have. Just open a feature request on SourceForge.
2018-03-07 03:22:54	Abhi18022	mpan: you can say that i just have a suggestion to make that application more helpfull in learning :)
2018-03-07 03:23:10	[codemonkey]	Abhi18022, you said if you had the source code you might be able to customise it yourself.  I linked you the source code and you decided you wouldn't have the knowledge so need one of the coders help.  I provided you with the forum of the developers, and now you're saying it's not a coding issue?
2018-03-07 03:23:10	MacGyver	badpixel: If they *are* the same, what happens if you mkfs.ext4 with the options -E lazy_itable_init=0 -E lazy_journal=0

2018-03-07 03:23:37	[codemonkey]	In any case Abhi18022 it's the klvaro developers you want to talk to, not the arch package maintainer
2018-03-07 03:23:59	mpan	Abhi18022: this is unrelated to what idea you have. If it is related to the software itself, not Arch Linux, open a feature request on SF. If this is related to Arch only, open a feature request for Arch Linux package.

2018-03-07 03:24:34	MacGyver	Right, so it's not missing any filesystem-related modules.
2018-03-07 03:24:47	MacGyver	badpixel: See what happens if you mkfs.ext4 with the options -E lazy_itable_init=0 -E lazy_journal=0
2018-03-07 03:24:57	badpixel	let me try
2018-03-07 03:25:04	MacGyver	badpixel: Also keep an eye on dmesg for I/O errors.
2018-03-07 03:25:08	Mart|n	mcintosh, pacman -Oo or something
2018-03-07 03:25:18	MacGyver	badpixel: At this point I'm inclined to think that yeah, that card is simply bad.
2018-03-07 03:25:29	Mart|n	MacGyver, even 
2018-03-07 03:25:34	beest	i'd expect it to be a bad card too, but i would also expect mkfs to complain
2018-03-07 03:26:00	MacGyver	You would, except that mkfs does hardly anything synchronized.
2018-03-07 03:26:39	beest	sd cards like to eat blocks silently and mysteriously
2018-03-07 03:26:42	badpixel	MacGyver: i just buy it today. but its possible. i try ubuntu arm and no problem to boot. 
2018-03-07 03:26:53	beest	i'd sooner wonder if it was the reader
2018-03-07 03:27:20	beest	so you dd'd an image with no issues?

2018-03-07 03:37:41	badpixel	im not use gnome
2018-03-07 03:38:02	MacGyver	badpixel: You mentioned something about it working under ubuntu?
2018-03-07 03:38:27	badpixel	sd card boot and work nice with ubuntu arm.
2018-03-07 03:38:53	MacGyver	How did you write ubuntu arm to it?
2018-03-07 03:38:58	badpixel	but is a complete diff install. just try to teste sd card
2018-03-07 03:39:05	badpixel	test*
2018-03-07 03:41:39	badpixel	MacGyver: download .img and then xzcat ubuntu.img.xz | sudo dd bs=4M of=/dev/mmcblk0
2018-03-07 03:43:19	MacGyver	At this point I'd do one of two things: boot a liveUSB from a different distro to check whether it has the same problem, or try a different, known-good SD-card to check whether it has the same problem.
2018-03-07 03:43:44	MacGyver	If it doesn't, it's the software. If it does, move to a machine with a different reader.
2018-03-07 03:43:44	Lartza	!give badpixel arm
2018-03-07 03:43:46	phrik	badpixel: the ARM (Archlinux Rollback Machine) is now called ALA (Arch Linux Archive) https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux_Archive
2018-03-07 03:43:50	Lartza	mhh
2018-03-07 03:43:51	MacGyver	They're not *on* ARM.
2018-03-07 03:43:54	Lartza	No?
2018-03-07 03:43:56	MacGyver	No.
2018-03-07 03:44:13	MacGyver	They're trying to format and mount an SD card for eventual use wíth ALARM, yes.
2018-03-07 03:44:21	MacGyver	But the formatting and mounting is happening in Arch.
2018-03-07 03:44:29	Lartza	Ah
2018-03-07 03:44:37	Mart|n	i downloaded alarmpi image
2018-03-07 03:45:24	Lartza	Though it's still really an #archlinux-arm discussion
2018-03-07 03:45:35	Mart|n	ye it is
2018-03-07 03:48:26	badpixel	MacGyver: thanks for the help. ill try with using another sd and computer. thanks for the help. 
2018-03-07 03:49:31	MacGyver	Lartza: No, it is not.
2018-03-07 03:49:51	MacGyver	They're literally having mount issues with hardware in Arch. How is that ever not topical for support here?
2018-03-07 03:50:06	Lartza	To me it sounds like it's an issue with formatting the card?
2018-03-07 03:50:18	Lartza	If an ext4 partition created with dd works
2018-03-07 03:50:26	kcseb	Well. I am back and now WiFi is dead period. 
2018-03-07 03:50:57	kcseb	I've ran sudo wifi-menu, but it gives an error about the job not being able to start. I've built broadcom-wl, nothing is working.

2018-03-07 16:37:10	neiluj	however in the wiki it is explained how to make it not world readable
2018-03-07 16:37:24	neiluj	I followed this instruction
2018-03-07 16:38:38	Lartza	neiluj, You set what permissions?
2018-03-07 16:39:00	qrf	"Failed to lookup alias 'crypto_user': Function not implemented"
2018-03-07 16:39:16	qrf	systemd-modules-load is failing with that. Hm.
2018-03-07 16:39:21	qrf	Anybody ever seen anything like that?
2018-03-07 16:39:36	neiluj	Lartza: the permissions here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Apache_HTTP_Server#User_directories

2018-03-07 16:39:49	Lartza	So those are world readable then
2018-03-07 16:40:22	neiluj	yes, but I commented out the line Include conf/extra/httpd-userdir.conf
2018-03-07 16:40:45	badpixel	[codemonkey]: are you on?
2018-03-07 16:40:59	[codemonkey]	hi
2018-03-07 16:41:02	neiluj	because I was concerned about my home dir being available on the internet
2018-03-07 16:41:13	[codemonkey]	did your card work?
2018-03-07 16:42:07	Lartza	neiluj, Umm... how do you expect ~username to work then
2018-03-07 16:42:15	badpixel	[codemonkey]: nope. u just replace for a new sd card on the store. and i have the same error when tried on my laptop and in other arch device. same error. new sd card, diff devices 
2018-03-07 16:42:20	badpixel	I*
2018-03-07 16:42:24	hyperlumic	neiluj: That config file is what makes http user directories work. :P

2018-03-07 16:43:25	badpixel	both arch updated with last packages. need to test whit instalation media. McGuyver aks me to try it.  
2018-03-07 16:43:27	[codemonkey]	I don't know if there's some inherant difference in SD cards
2018-03-07 16:43:36	badpixel	[codemonkey]: is not. 
2018-03-07 16:43:39	[codemonkey]	I tried it too yesterday, but with a USB stick not SD card
2018-03-07 16:43:45	neiluj	Lartza and hyperlumic : I understand now, but the wiki showed how to not make it world readable
2018-03-07 16:43:47	[codemonkey]	and it mounted fine
2018-03-07 16:44:03	Lartza	neiluj, Right?
2018-03-07 16:44:11	[codemonkey]	badpixel did you try to make just one partition, not using that guide?
2018-03-07 16:44:17	zesterer	Pryka: I can't see anything out of the ordinary. Perhaps it's an issue with me not also defining my Intel card?
2018-03-07 16:44:21	Lartza	neiluj, Doesn't make it any less internet-inaccessible...
2018-03-07 16:44:24	badpixel	[codemonkey]: when i tried the same with my pendrive i can mount ext4 partitions. 
2018-03-07 16:44:38	[codemonkey]	uh
2018-03-07 16:44:44	[codemonkey]	do sd cards have a little switch on them?

2018-03-07 16:46:06	badpixel	yes.
2018-03-07 16:46:19	[codemonkey]	does the pi3 have a usb port you could run off instead?
2018-03-07 16:46:31	[codemonkey]	not ideal really
2018-03-07 16:46:57	gnulligan	when I run pacman-key --refresh-keys I keep getting "No space left on device" errors

2018-03-07 16:47:41	badpixel	yes. 4 usb ports. but how can i write that to use like a usb stick? need a .img to dd. and alarm no have that 
2018-03-07 16:48:25	zesterer	Pryka: I don't want to though: I want the option of using "i915" or "radeon" for running individual applications. Right now it works, but using the radeon driver produces really bad tearing while screencasting
2018-03-07 16:48:37	[codemonkey]	uhm
2018-03-07 16:48:44	zesterer	Pryka: Thanks for your help :) I'll keep trying things
2018-03-07 16:48:45	[codemonkey]	in exactly the same you're writing to the sd card
2018-03-07 16:48:52	Pryka	zesterer: np
2018-03-07 16:48:55	[codemonkey]	just replace /dev/whateveritwas with /dev/sdX
2018-03-07 16:49:19	[codemonkey]	I don't know if the pi will boot off usb though, I think it just boots off the sd
2018-03-07 16:49:25	[codemonkey]	wait isn't pi microsd anyway?
2018-03-07 16:49:39	[codemonkey]	using an adapter?
2018-03-07 16:49:47	Mart|n	pi microsd...and u can setup t to boot of usb with firmware hack
2018-03-07 16:49:47	NoImNotNineVolt	i915>*
2018-03-07 16:50:21	[codemonkey]	but can you hack the firmware if you can't make an sdcard to boot it in the first place Mart|n?
2018-03-07 16:50:58	badpixel	[codemonkey]: need adapter to prepare sd on  my laptop to boot on pi. pi is micro sd 
2018-03-07 16:51:04	Mart|n	he made ubuntu one tho.....just download the image for alarmpi and do the same u did with uvuntu image
2018-03-07 16:51:06	[codemonkey]	the problem badpixel is having isn't really anything to do with the pi, it's just the partitioning and mounting of sd card in arch
2018-03-07 16:51:24	badpixel	^ thats it
2018-03-07 16:51:27	NoImNotNineVolt	an adapter is like $0.50
2018-03-07 16:51:39	[codemonkey]	badpixel can you try the sdcard on a different os and see what happens, like a windows machine or something?

2018-03-07 16:52:51	badpixel	[codemonkey]: ill try on ubuntu. and with arch installation media. need to get in home to test. and need to find some ubuntu machine borrowed lol 
2018-03-07 16:53:17	[codemonkey]	badpixel I'm honestly way out of my depth with this, all the input I had yesterday was just from searches while you were explaining the problem
2018-03-07 16:53:21	Mart|n	ye i know wha guide he following.but as i say if he wants arch to work on pi..and to test the pi writing the sd card using pi as the install medium it worth a shot
2018-03-07 16:53:39	[codemonkey]	yeah sure
2018-03-07 16:53:40	kevr	its not arch installation media

2018-03-07 16:55:19	kevr	join if you want to be respectful
2018-03-07 16:55:50	kevr	we can help you out over there.
2018-03-07 16:55:54	[codemonkey]	they might have some insight, even if you're not at the ARM related step yet
2018-03-07 16:56:14	badpixel	kevr: ill join. but i repeat. is not a arm issue. is arch issue. im on arch laptop try to mount a sd card. how thiis can be alarm issue?
2018-03-07 16:56:34	[codemonkey]	^
2018-03-07 16:56:43	badpixel	and i try on 2 arch devices, whit 2 sd cards. and i have the same problem
2018-03-07 16:56:51	Lartza	So your reader is bad?
2018-03-07 16:56:54	[codemonkey]	I'm going back to watching card captor sakura, good luck
2018-03-07 16:57:16	[codemonkey]	Lartza two bad readers? coincidence but not impossible
2018-03-07 16:57:23	Lartza	Two readers?
2018-03-07 16:57:28	badpixel	[codemonkey]: ill try your suggestion
2018-03-07 16:57:39	kevr	badpixel
2018-03-07 16:57:44	Lartza	2 devices, 2 readers, 2 sd cards?
2018-03-07 16:57:46	kevr	fine, i give up
2018-03-07 16:57:50	kevr	lets see
2018-03-07 16:58:11	kevr	badpixel, take our your dongle or your mmc card
2018-03-07 16:58:12	badpixel	Lartza: i replace the sd card on the store. new test, same error. then new arch device. other laptop. same error.
2018-03-07 16:58:28	kevr	then plug it back in and look at `dmesg` to see what happened
2018-03-07 16:58:39	▷	jsgrant_ will probably look into tonight a bit more after some break; Have a number of things to build from Aur before I'm too ant-up-the-aah
2018-03-07 16:58:39	kevr	did it mount? if so, what's the message? use a pastebin service like ptpbw
2018-03-07 16:58:45	kevr	ptpb* whatever
2018-03-07 16:59:06	Mart|n	maybe try sync after u dun mkfs'ing

2018-03-07 16:59:27	badpixel	i just start  cgdisk --zap-all 
2018-03-07 16:59:29	kevr	well, sorry, not mount, but your base device should be recognized
2018-03-07 17:01:26	kevr	badpixel, the problem is that you're following this guide that have things you're supposed to replace
2018-03-07 17:02:03	kevr	you need a mount point in order to mount them properly
2018-03-07 17:02:08	kevr	mkdir {boot,root}
2018-03-07 17:02:16	kevr	mount blah boot, mount blah root
2018-03-07 17:03:03	kevr	you should also maybe use fdisk and fsck utilities to verify that your partitions are actually good
2018-03-07 17:03:28	badpixel	i try to setup one partition ext4 only, for all sd. i have problems to mount. one partition with fat32 works fine
2018-03-07 17:03:58	kevr	oh, so fat works fine? interesting
2018-03-07 17:04:18	kevr	so what does your fdisk say, i'm curious
2018-03-07 17:04:22	badpixel	yes. i can mount and access. write data and clean
2018-03-07 17:04:28	kevr	if you fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
2018-03-07 17:04:37	kevr	what listings do you get? (please use a pastebin service)
2018-03-07 17:04:39	badpixel	i have that let me paste the link
2018-03-07 17:04:43	kevr	right on
2018-03-07 17:05:27	[codemonkey]	kevr that's why I gave some instructions to zap it and just create one partition, cut out all extra steps
2018-03-07 17:05:30	[codemonkey]	sanity check
2018-03-07 17:07:25	majuscule	How can I debug a device xorg conf.d file not matching a usb device? i am trying to use the mtrack driver, but libinput takes it every time

2018-03-07 17:12:23	gnulligan	df -h give 100% in /run/hyperiso/bootmnt and /run/hyperiso/sfs/root-image
2018-03-07 17:12:58	kevr	im betting Mart|n's right with that
2018-03-07 17:13:17	gnulligan	Mart|n: this is an installation
2018-03-07 17:13:49	Namarrgon	what is "hyperiso"? a remastered arch iso?
2018-03-07 17:14:04	gnulligan	yeah it's hyperbola
2018-03-07 17:14:17	Namarrgon	then you're in the wrong channel
2018-03-07 17:14:37	gnulligan	no its just deblobbed arch

2018-03-07 17:14:44	Namarrgon	yes, it's not arch anymore
2018-03-07 17:15:33	gnulligan	Mart|n: what is /dev/mmcblah?
2018-03-07 17:16:04	guys	gnulligan: not arch, that's what it is
2018-03-07 17:16:16	Namarrgon	gnulligan: that was meant for badpixel, not you
2018-03-07 17:16:30	Mart|n	thnx Namarrgon 
2018-03-07 17:17:00	guys	gnulligan: considering that hyperbola's deblobbing causes weird hardware failures, claiming it is "deblobbed arch" is totally missing the point
2018-03-07 17:17:30	gnulligan	well there aren't any h/w failures
2018-03-07 17:17:48	Namarrgon	please seek support in your distro's channel, or try it in ##linux
2018-03-07 17:17:53	kevr	Look, if it's not *Arch Linux*, it's not Arch Linux.
2018-03-07 17:18:17	Namarrgon	tl;dr your ramdisk is full
2018-03-07 17:18:24	guys	gnulligan: they override and blacklist our packages, provide a different underlying kernelspace/userland, and generally aren't us
2018-03-07 17:18:26	kevr	It doesn't matter if it was derived from Arch Linux, or the idea began with Arch Linux, those other distros evolve into their own worlds, and supporting them here would just be disasterous.
2018-03-07 17:18:47	guys	asking for support here is just plain rude and gives hyperbola a bad name
2018-03-07 17:20:21	gnulligan	lol I didn't realize I was being rud
2018-03-07 17:20:22	gnulligan	rude
2018-03-07 17:21:14	gnulligan	I'll retry with arch
2018-03-07 17:30:56	Psi-Jack	Heh
2018-03-07 17:31:42	[codemonkey]	badpixel cfdisk?  I don't see any mention of it in that paste.  Besides, I said cgdisk so why mention cfdisk?
2018-03-07 17:32:12	[codemonkey]	also, none of what's in that pastebin is what I suggested that you do at all, did you post the wrong link?
2018-03-07 17:32:52	Mart|n	badpixel try  mount -t extfs4 /dev/mmcblah root
2018-03-07 17:33:16	Mart|n	as fdisk sees the partition marker for extfs4 before u make it
2018-03-07 17:34:04	[codemonkey]	badpixel can I ssh into your box? :D
2018-03-07 17:34:26	[codemonkey]	or one of us

2018-03-07 17:35:26	Psi-Jack	Really bad about that. ;)
2018-03-07 17:36:14	badpixel	[codemonkey]: when i in home i can provide ssh to you sir. for sure. now im at work. cant redirect to my laptop
2018-03-07 17:36:18	jsgrant_	Ha, okay, I just ended up not being able to stop and started setting up my secondary archlinux install and Intellij doesn't work there too... 
2018-03-07 17:36:27	jsgrant_	Also brand-new install.
2018-03-07 17:36:45	zaratustra	badpixel: whats wrong mister
2018-03-07 17:36:48	jsgrant_	Haven't tried building from Aur though on that one; Same mismatch error regardless on main ce
2018-03-07 17:37:05	badpixel	zaratustra: my SD card cant mount on archlinux
2018-03-07 17:37:21	krumelmonster	Anyone here using su or sudo with a password? (How) Do you protect yourself from privilege escalation through altered bashrc/LD_PRELOAD/PATH?
2018-03-07 17:37:33	Lartza	Mart|n, extfs4?
2018-03-07 17:38:12	[codemonkey]	yeah it's a thing apparently
2018-03-07 17:38:36	Psi-Jack	Heh, yeah, and "extfs4?" wat?
2018-03-07 17:38:47	[codemonkey]	haven't looked at man but saw that on google
2018-03-07 17:38:53	[codemonkey]	could have been a typo
2018-03-07 17:38:55	Psi-Jack	ext4, ext4fs, I've heard of, but extfs4, no.
2018-03-07 17:38:58	zaratustra	badpixel: what do you mean on archlinux? you're positive it isnt a faulty sd?
2018-03-07 17:39:16	[codemonkey]	lol badpixel is gonna get so sick of that question
2018-03-07 17:39:35	zaratustra	sorry im late to the party =/
2018-03-07 17:39:53	badpixel	[codemonkey]: sd card is ok. i replace it on the store. tried on 2 archlinux devices. same error
2018-03-07 17:39:56	Mart|n	badpixel try  mount -t ext4 /dev/mmcblah root
2018-03-07 17:39:59	badpixel	sorry zaratustra ^
2018-03-07 17:40:07	Mart|n	sorry i  remember the  tag wrong
2018-03-07 17:40:07	badpixel	Mart|n: i paste what happens
2018-03-07 17:40:15	zaratustra	badpixel: you tried a second sd? this is mindblowing
2018-03-07 17:40:22	[codemonkey]	I recon it's the adapter you have, or did you try different adapter?
2018-03-07 17:40:24	zaratustra	and other distro works fine?

2018-03-07 17:40:29	[codemonkey]	because it is microsd inside sd right?
2018-03-07 17:40:38	zaratustra	its just ext4 lol
2018-03-07 17:40:39	Mart|n	i wrote the command wrong e.g extfs4 ..u nedd just ext4
2018-03-07 17:40:41	krumelmonster	Is it even possible to protect oneself from this kind of privilege escalation? What if you use X11 to type in your sudo/root password? http://turbochaos.blogspot.de/2013/11/ghetto-privilege-escalation-with-bashrc.html

2018-03-07 17:41:16	badpixel	zaratustra: yes. i ask for replace on the store. they give me new sd card
2018-03-07 17:41:29	MacGyver	zaratustra: Well, not mindblowing as much as "there may be an actual issue in the software here".
2018-03-07 17:41:30	krumelmonster	zaratustra: So I should use passwordless sudo?
2018-03-07 17:41:44	MacGyver	I'm still wondering about testing cross-distros.
2018-03-07 17:42:06	[codemonkey]	hey MacGyver welcome back to the mad house
2018-03-07 17:42:16	badpixel	Mart|n: mount: /home/igor/archarm64/root: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/mmcblk0p2, missing codepage or helper program, or other error.
2018-03-07 17:42:22	zaratustra	krumelmonster: I'm not telling you what to do, esp. not anything security wise... 
2018-03-07 17:42:47	Mart|n	ok badpixel still am at blank then
2018-03-07 17:42:48	zaratustra	badpixel: what kernel are you running
2018-03-07 17:43:06	zaratustra	did you try other versions of arch isos
2018-03-07 17:43:27	[codemonkey]	zaratustra originally was trying with mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p2 and mounting, which gives the error just posted
2018-03-07 17:43:29	zaratustra	MacGyver: yup
2018-03-07 17:43:35	krumelmonster	zaratustra: It was a kind of rhethoric question: What's the point of using a sudo password if it's effectively ineffective?
2018-03-07 17:43:51	badpixel	need to test with instalaltion media like McGuyver ask me. and in another OS like ubuntu. my last options, i think 
2018-03-07 17:44:04	zaratustra	krumelmonster: whats the point of using rooted cpus? well, you just use em I guess?
2018-03-07 17:44:25	zaratustra	badpixel: most def. you should test other isos
2018-03-07 17:44:50	badpixel	zaratustra: i can boot sd card with ubuntu arm. 
2018-03-07 17:45:06	zaratustra	oh yes but can you mount it? :P
2018-03-07 17:45:28	[codemonkey]	krumelmonster if you set up an unprivilaged user on your machine, can you actually achieve that escalation?
2018-03-07 17:45:32	krumelmonster	zaratustra: What's "rooted cpus" supposed to mean?
2018-03-07 17:45:54	zaratustra	I mean the attackers you should really care about have got you by the balls already

2018-03-07 17:46:00	the-pete	krumelmonster: also remotely
2018-03-07 17:46:00	krumelmonster	[codemonkey]: Not unprivileged but sudoer/wheel.
2018-03-07 17:46:03	badpixel	and can mount both
2018-03-07 17:46:25	[codemonkey]	if you're sudo/wheel then what's escalated?  don't you already have full access?
2018-03-07 17:46:41	the-pete	I bet that an unprivledged user that only used keyauth and no password sudo beats most defense senarios
2018-03-07 17:46:59	zaratustra	[codemonkey]: he's worried about passwd hijacking when typing since he doesnt like using NOPASSWD
2018-03-07 17:47:41	krumelmonster	[codemonkey]: If you need a password to use sudo, you might *think* you need that password for full access but in fact, you don't. So why bother and use a sudo password?
2018-03-07 17:47:46	the-pete	sure, but what's hyjackinf the password if you have to have a password to install yourself?
2018-03-07 17:47:49	kevr	man.
2018-03-07 17:48:10	[codemonkey]	then don't use NOPASSWD?
2018-03-07 17:48:31	zaratustra	the-pete: somehow by "altered bashrc/LD_PRELOAD/PATH" and "use X11 to type the passwd"
2018-03-07 17:49:02	krumelmonster	[codemonkey]: No, a sudo password is ineffective so using NOPASSWD would be consequential
2018-03-07 17:49:16	[codemonkey]	goddamit I was trying to watch crap anime and now I have to read this blog -.-
2018-03-07 17:49:30	zaratustra	krumelmonster: ineffective how? where is the proof of concept technique?

2018-03-07 17:56:31	the-pete	if they are loging in at console, it's too late.  If they have physical access to your machine you're rooted

2018-03-07 17:57:32	the-pete	well, who goes in a cage with a lion and worries about keeping their pockets zipped up
2018-03-07 17:57:33	krumelmonster	the-pete: Maybe a buffer overflow in your irc client.
2018-03-07 17:57:35	the-pete	?
2018-03-07 17:59:11	the-pete	ok, so then from there, what does it do?  What's the plan for escallation?
2018-03-07 17:59:41	krumelmonster	I just thought I had really missed something and everyone used their sudo more securily than me but apparently not.
2018-03-07 18:00:04	[codemonkey]	krumelmonster, doesn't this essentially boil down to social engineering? or an alredy privilaged user being malicious?

2018-03-07 18:02:23	krumelmonster	the-pete: Ok, nowadays a simple buffer overflow won't get you remote code excecution, still this is something that could happen in your browser, irc client, document viewer etc. Any code code excecuted with privileges of a sudoer user will be able to get local root next time you use sudo without needing a password (->privilege escalation).

2018-03-07 18:04:59	[codemonkey]	the thing is krumelmonster a lot of the things you're suggesting that would put an attacker in the position to do this, they'd already have pwned your system

2018-03-07 18:05:28	the-pete	so which unprivledged remote code execution vulnerability are you thinking I'm affected by?
2018-03-07 18:05:29	[codemonkey]	it's a not escalation, it's plateua

2018-03-07 18:06:48	[codemonkey]	I may be completely misunderstanding but the analogy is 'I dropped my keys and someone else found them. What's to stop them making a copy of my keys to open my door?'
2018-03-07 18:07:00	[codemonkey]	well they already have your keys, so why would they bother making a copy?

2018-03-07 18:08:24	guys	krumelmonster: BTW regarding that bashrc escalation thing, I've done that before, but 1) using bash-completion because who looks for malicious code in ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/sudo and 2) that writer is a fool and should learn to use bash arrays, or in this case POSIX "$@"
2018-03-07 18:08:25	[codemonkey]	the attack vectors are - zero day, social engineering, coercion

2018-03-07 18:12:09	seth	I figured out that passing in more than 2 CPU cores to QEMU causes high DPC latency.
2018-03-07 18:12:22	seth	Because WIndows doesn't interrupt with more than 2 cores.

2018-03-07 18:15:17	guys	krumelmonster: ... or like I said, defining a sudo function in ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions which unsets itself after grabbing a password :D

2018-03-07 18:19:33	guys	chrisf: bash completions run in the shell you want to complete for, obviously
2018-03-07 18:19:57	guys	how would a subshell even work -_-
2018-03-07 18:20:46	guys	e.g. $ tail -1 /etc/bash.bashrc 
2018-03-07 18:20:48	guys	[ -r /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion   ] && . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
2018-03-07 18:21:16	guys	and /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion will define the _completion_loader function, so try running the following in a bash shell
2018-03-07 18:21:22	guys	declare -f _completion_loader
2018-03-07 18:21:47	guys	Well, that really proxies to __load_completion anyway
2018-03-07 18:22:19	guys	but generally, try tab-completing _<TAB> and see all the functions defined by random command completions
2018-03-07 18:22:23	badpixel	[codemonkey]: lol. ubuntu dd .img can mount ext4 partition. https://ptpb.pw/-KWo and new sd boot and work nice

2018-03-07 18:23:50	guys	chrisf: heh, try git <TAB> to get git(1) tab completion loaded, then _<TAB> and look at the many functions that creates
2018-03-07 18:24:38	guys	in a brand new shell, that is 180 hidden functions defined
2018-03-07 18:26:58	guys	krumelmonster: the problem with using tee, is that it waits for CTRL+D rather than <ENTER>
2018-03-07 18:27:23	krumelmonster	guys: Obviously this is a proof-of-concept ;)
2018-03-07 18:28:06	chrisf	guys: right, the current approach is a mile of duct tape.
2018-03-07 18:28:36	krumelmonster	Once we get rid of X11, sudoer to root wouldn't have to be plateau.
2018-03-07 18:28:47	guys	chrisf: how can you possibly modify the actual shell behavior without scoping things to the shell? This is a feature, not a bug.
2018-03-07 18:29:38	guys	... not saying that bash completion specifically is the best approach, but that makes it sound as though zsh would be better...
2018-03-07 18:30:39	guys	zsh also loads completion functions, it's just smarter about finding the right file to source
2018-03-07 18:30:50	krumelmonster	But I'm sorry, the question was off-topic from the start.
2018-03-07 18:31:41	chrisf	guys: there's no real reason to need completion commands to be able to leave crud in the caller
2018-03-07 18:32:28	guys	but you do have to define it in the shell itself. It happens to be implemented via the `complete` builtin yes
2018-03-07 18:33:08	guys	python and other real programming languages can simply introspect the method type to figure out how to complete
2018-03-07 18:37:14	[codemonkey]	krumelmonster, all of the stuff you're talking about is easily mitigated.  Yes there are attack vectors, but that blog post is not some breaking problem that makes you say 'what is the point of passwords/NOPASSWD'
2018-03-07 18:37:41	[codemonkey]	it's definitely an interesting topic
2018-03-07 18:37:51	[codemonkey]	and we love to chat about such things
2018-03-07 18:38:39	krumelmonster	[codemonkey]: If you're using X11, I doubt mitigation to be possible. If you talk about tty, I doubt anyone here has mitigated this.
2018-03-07 18:38:43	[codemonkey]	so chat away about it, but I don't think the blog post has any real world use
2018-03-07 18:40:04	[codemonkey]	badpixel yeah pretty much, just use the equivilant tools
2018-03-07 18:42:06	[codemonkey]	krumelmonster, I probably joined the channel late into the discussion.  Do you have an actual issue or is this purely academic?  If you think you've identified a weakness, have you actually tried to use it?
2018-03-07 18:43:05	[codemonkey]	please answer truthfully
2018-03-07 18:43:25	[codemonkey]	I mean.. openly

2018-03-07 18:44:48	[codemonkey]	also I'm really drunk so anything I say past here I may apologise for at a later date
2018-03-07 18:48:56	krumelmonster	[codemonkey]: I haven't actually tried to use it but I tested enough to be certain that some of the approaches mentioned work. My original question was whether this is an issue of my configuration/sudo usage or insecurity by design. I now believe it to be the latter and don't consider it to be realisitc to mitigate it on any of my systems. Also, I wanted to mention it because I think many Linux users believe th
2018-03-07 18:48:56	krumelmonster	 a great deal of security (I remember the sudo setup of Ubuntu to be one of it's major selling points in terms of security). A consequence I've taken already is to always run untrusted and closed-source software as a different, unprivileged user although this might not even make a difference in the X11 keylog scenario.
2018-03-07 18:49:55	krumelmonster	(And is imho the only sane choice for many reasons)
2018-03-07 18:49:56	guys	well, sandboxing is generally not a *bad* thing :)

2018-03-07 18:53:24	demonicmaniac3	sadly things like dmenu and such kinda DEPEND on what makes keylogging in x11 possible
2018-03-07 18:53:26	[codemonkey]	If you are sysadmin and you have a lot of users, impose strong passwords on the system, but you have to work with the managers in the company to enforce those rules.

2018-03-07 18:57:13	hyperlumic	This is what leads to the revelation that security is not and has never been a game of eliminating risk. It's about reducing risk to acceptable levels.
2018-03-07 18:57:15	[codemonkey]	it's a non-issue

2018-03-07 18:58:20	krumelmonster	[codemonkey]: And as long as you keep using X11, everyone can watch you grab it a few times a day.

What if you use X11 to type in your sudo/root password?" I was under the impression that using a sudoer user and a sudo password was *supposed* to actually introduce another layer of protection between a user application that has – say: A remote code excectution vulnerability – and the system.

2018-03-07 19:45:57	Sakara	can filesystems in df output ever have a space in the name of the filesystem?
2018-03-07 19:47:53	badpixel	guys: lol. 
2018-03-07 19:48:02	badpixel	nice drama pic hahaha
2018-03-07 19:52:50	guys	Sakara: whyever not
2018-03-07 19:53:03	guys	the output includes the mountpoint
2018-03-07 19:54:09	guys	As for the block device, that can be in /dev or e.g. "/home/Sakara/iso images/foo.img"
2018-03-07 19:56:18	guys	oh, well, that does end up showing as a loop device, scratch that
2018-03-07 19:58:00	Sakara	yup thats the bit I'm wondering about.
2018-03-07 19:58:21	Sakara	I'm going to write a script to parse it but I don't know if I need to account for spaces.
2018-03-07 19:58:35	guys	You would have to somehow create a /dev/ that has a space in it
2018-03-07 19:59:07	sheep	like in /dev/disk/by-label?
2018-03-07 19:59:21	occultus	i think by-label escapes pretty much everything
2018-03-07 20:00:03	occultus	by-partlabel has a bunch of \x20, the \ itself also needing to be escaped in a shell :S
2018-03-07 20:00:04	guys	Sakara: anyways, do not parse df
2018-03-07 20:00:16	guys	if you need mounts, findmnt does a lot better
2018-03-07 20:00:35	Sakara	Its attempting to capture disk usage.
2018-03-07 20:00:51	Sakara	I'm using Arch on some boxes and some bsds on others to the script needs to parse both outputs.
2018-03-07 20:01:21	Sakara	I'll play around and hopefully nobody mounts a device with space in it :)
2018-03-07 20:07:20	guys	hmm, is there any nice tool which provide a machine-parseable interface for statfs(2) or something
2018-03-07 20:09:11	earnestly	guys: findmnt?
2018-03-07 20:09:28	earnestly	Not sure what machine-parsable means here if statfs is literally not that
2018-03-07 20:09:33	guys	earnestly: free space included?
2018-03-07 20:09:44	guys	statfs is a kernel function not a bash tool
2018-03-07 20:09:54	guys	stat can do it with --file-system and %f
2018-03-07 20:10:03	guys	So there we have it
2018-03-07 20:10:12	▷	guys needs to learn more about stat options
2018-03-07 20:10:38	earnestly	guys: machine-parsable and bash don't go together, superficially
2018-03-07 20:10:46	earnestly	You mind shell friendly perhaps
2018-03-07 20:11:02	earnestly	But yes, different tools would be needed
2018-03-07 20:12:13	earnestly	mind/might mean
2018-03-07 20:19:07	guys	Sakara: so basically `stat -fc "%n type=%T free=%f total=%b blocksize=%S" "$filesystem"` is nicely parseable
2018-03-07 20:21:58	guys	Actually, wait
2018-03-07 20:22:00	guys	findmnt -DJ
2018-03-07 20:22:09	guys	==> json output that emulates df
2018-03-07 20:22:36	guys	okay, yeah, that is a win
2018-03-07 20:27:22	guys	Could also iterate over lines for `findmnt -Po TARGET,SIZE,AVAIL`
2018-03-07 20:28:37	guys	yeahhhh, util-linux is nicer than coreutils

2018-03-07 20:40:21	aegis	guys and earnestly I spoke with the package maintainer about the problem earlier and he thinks it's something he has to fix on his end.  No one reported the problem yet since most folks aren't running the latest harfbuzz package.

2018-03-07 20:50:34	guys	aegis: oh, 1.7.6?
2018-03-07 20:52:57	aegis	guys: It was actually lib32-harfbuzz...  looks like it was updated on March 1 2018 which makes sense because the app worked for me up until that point.  Anyway, they are going to look into it.  Thanks for your help earlier.
2018-03-07 20:53:46	aegis	It's just a utility to interface with my Elecraft KX3 radio
2018-03-07 20:55:43	guys	aegis: oh, haha -- by coincidence harfbuzz 1.7.6 was released 11 hours ago and is not yet packaged
2018-03-07 20:55:54	⚡	fstd_ is now known as fstd
2018-03-07 20:56:04	guys	but lib32 would also explain why people were less likely to notice
2018-03-07 20:56:14	aegis	guys: Of course it was! Thanks for letting me know.  I'll relay that.
2018-03-07 20:56:26	aegis	I wonder if that fixes the issue I was having
2018-03-07 20:57:31	guys	aegis: relay that where -- I already flagged it ood
2018-03-07 20:58:23	aegis	guys: Sorry, I meant I'd let the guy who maintains the KX3 utility app know there is already a newer version of harfbuzz out.
2018-03-07 20:58:36	aegis	(the app that broke on me)

2018-03-07 21:52:17	Sakara	guys: the JSON output from findmnt looks like a winner. I just found a server with a CIFS network share mounted. The Windows share name has a space in it. The df output also has a space in it.
2018-03-07 21:59:35	guys	Sakara: :)
2018-03-07 22:16:05	ilmostro	aegis: oh wow, so there's a bug in the harfbuzz? I remember you sharing the dmesg logs yesterday 
2018-03-07 22:18:16	bemeurer	Is there any way to run btrfs-check on boot?
2018-03-07 22:18:28	bemeurer	I use a space cache that gets invalidated on impropershutdowns
2018-03-07 22:18:37	CompanionCube	isn't btrfs-check slow af
2018-03-07 22:18:53	bemeurer	It's easily fixed by invalidating the cache, which btrfs-check does 
2018-03-07 22:19:02	bemeurer	CompanionCube: Not if there's nothing wrong with the drive :)
2018-03-07 22:20:28	CompanionCube	is it a common btrfs issue to have a space cache that unlike the rest of the thing, doesn't properly handle unplanned shutdowns? I'd imagine that would be a bug..
2018-03-07 22:21:04	bemeurer	Maybe, it might be a bug due to the LUKS + BTRFS + ZSTD combination
2018-03-07 22:21:07	gnulligan	hey guys, I'm trying to install arch with just a root partition and a swap partition using parted. should I give my root partition the boot flag or no?
2018-03-07 22:21:18	bemeurer	gnulligan: No.
2018-03-07 22:21:22	Scimmia	I had it happen twice on dozens, maybe hundreds of unclean shutdowns
2018-03-07 22:21:25	bemeurer	Only your boot partition has the boot flag
2018-03-07 22:21:35	bemeurer	and if you're on UEFI you need a boot partition (IIRC)
2018-03-07 22:21:51	bemeurer	(Wait for others' answers, I may not be correct)
2018-03-07 22:21:51	gnulligan	bemeurer: oh... so it's necessary
2018-03-07 22:22:01	bemeurer	gnulligan: On UEFI, I think so
2018-03-07 22:22:10	bemeurer	On BIOS I think you can not-have a boot partition
2018-03-07 22:22:16	Scimmia	you need a fat32 partition with UEFI, no question
2018-03-07 22:22:24	bemeurer	Scimmia: Yeah, the ESP partition
2018-03-07 22:22:30	gnulligan	right!
2018-03-07 22:22:31	gnulligan	ESP
2018-03-07 22:22:41	Scimmia	yes, best to make it the esp, but it doesn't really have to be an ESP
2018-03-07 22:22:51	gnulligan	ok, so I'll make that. does it have to be fat32?
2018-03-07 22:23:00	Scimmia	yes
2018-03-07 22:23:00	gnulligan	or can I format it ext?
2018-03-07 22:23:13	bemeurer	Scimmia: It happens somewhat often to me, and I use this laptop a lot in places where I have no internet, and getting a rescue drive can take about a day of driving
2018-03-07 22:23:17	Scimmia	you could make it fat16 or fat12 if you really wanted, but not ext2
2018-03-07 22:23:32	gnulligan	Scimmia: ok so no ext
2018-03-07 22:23:35	gnulligan	thanks guys!
2018-03-07 22:23:41	bemeurer	gnulligan: np
2018-03-07 22:25:28	bemeurer	So, can I just make btrfs-check run automagically once I unlock the volume (sd-encrypt hook on mkinitcpio)
2018-03-07 22:26:01	Scimmia	I don't know of a hook for that, you may have to make your own
2018-03-07 22:26:35	Scimmia	or just make sure btrfs-check is in the initramfs so you can run it when there's actually a problem
2018-03-07 22:26:51	Scimmia	no real need to make it automatic, IMO
2018-03-07 22:27:01	bemeurer	Scimmia: So, when I had the issue I couldn't do _anything_
2018-03-07 22:27:16	bemeurer	I would get to the encryption password prompt
2018-03-07 22:27:28	bemeurer	And then as soon as systemd kicked in it would start crashing hard
2018-03-07 22:27:32	bemeurer	and freeze
2018-03-07 22:27:32	Scimmia	bemeurer: you're using a systemd based initramfs, do you also have the base hook so you can get a rescue prompt?
2018-03-07 22:27:44	bemeurer	Scimmia: AFAIK no
2018-03-07 22:27:48	Scimmia	that's why, then
2018-03-07 22:27:52	bemeurer	What hook is that?
2018-03-07 22:28:05	Scimmia	...I just said the base hook
2018-03-07 22:28:34	bemeurer	Oh
2018-03-07 22:28:40	bemeurer	I do have the base hook enabled

2018-03-07 22:29:06	Scimmia	then you should get a shell when it fails to mount the root fs
2018-03-07 22:29:47	bemeurer	Scimmia: So, it correctly mounts, otherwise sd wouldn't start the boot process
2018-03-07 22:29:55	bemeurer	But it would crash hard
2018-03-07 22:30:05	Scimmia	that makes no sense
2018-03-07 22:30:39	Scimmia	it's pivoting to the new root, but has space_cache errors?
2018-03-07 22:30:48	Scimmia	the mount should error out
2018-03-07 22:31:02	bemeurer	Well, the mount succeeds 
2018-03-07 22:31:14	Hello71	>btrfs
2018-03-07 22:31:16	Hello71	>sense
2018-03-07 22:31:20	bemeurer	But doesn't get past systemd, rarely would reach the login 
2018-03-07 22:31:24	bemeurer	And never would work
2018-03-07 22:31:38	bemeurer	btrfs-check from a live usb always fixed it
2018-03-07 22:31:41	Scimmia	so we're not talking about a hard error. interesting
2018-03-07 22:31:55	bemeurer	and it would always tell me "Invalidating space cache"
2018-03-07 22:32:01	Scimmia	bemeurer: anyway, break=premount in the kernel command line should drop you inside the initramfs
2018-03-07 22:32:50	bemeurer	Scimmia: But how would I change the kernel cmdline without booting?
2018-03-07 22:32:56	bemeurer	and without a liveusb
2018-03-07 22:33:22	Scimmia	bemeurer: by editing it with the bootloader. Unless you're using EFI Stub directly, you should be able to edit it
2018-03-07 22:33:24	bemeurer	IIRC corrupted space caches with LUKS is a known issue
2018-03-07 22:33:52	bemeurer	Scimmia: I am; I guess I should use GRUB instead in this case
2018-03-07 22:33:58	bemeurer	Make a "recue" entry
2018-03-07 22:34:07	bemeurer	*rescue
2018-03-07 22:34:08	Scimmia	why do people go straight to grub?
2018-03-07 22:34:21	bemeurer	Because it's what I know how to use 
2018-03-07 22:34:21	Scimmia	systemd-boot is a MUCH simpler option
2018-03-07 22:34:45	bemeurer	I can try that too
2018-03-07 22:35:32	Scimmia	systemd-boot is very similar to direct efi stub loading, it just presents a better menu then the one the firmware has built in, and gives you better options, such as editing the command line
2018-03-07 22:36:29	Scimmia	it's not really a bootloader, it's just a menu
2018-03-07 22:36:37	bemeurer	How do you add more entries to the menu?
2018-03-07 22:36:56	bemeurer	On grub I used a dreadful GUI that was somehow not as dreadful as doing it manually
2018-03-07 22:37:11	Scimmia	files in <esp>/loader/entries/
2018-03-07 22:37:24	Scimmia	they're dead simple, though, not like grub's
2018-03-07 22:37:40	bemeurer	Neat

2018-03-07 22:39:25	Scimmia	bemeurer: limitation is that it can only access files on the ESP. If you need to access other partitions, refind will do that
2018-03-07 22:39:29	amosbird	hmm
2018-03-07 22:40:15	guys	amosbird: but they basically just spin up an Arch Linux vm. :)

2018-03-07 22:59:22	sheep	usually. it could also mean that site doesn't mirror arch's repos anymore
2018-03-07 22:59:38	Scimmia	it's possible, but the former is much more likely

2018-03-07 23:03:36	amosbird	I'm trying to make this work https://la.wentropy.com/Gltf
2018-03-07 23:03:44	sheep	-S is fine. -Syu is fine. -Sy is dangerous
2018-03-07 23:03:45	Scimmia	partial updates are not supported, period.
2018-03-07 23:04:25	amosbird	ok, I'll try and see if the build succeed
2018-03-07 23:04:25	gnulligan	exactly how flexible is pacman? Like, if I wanted to switch from Manjaro to Parabola, could I do that with just pacman or would I need to reinstall the os?
2018-03-07 23:04:44	Scimmia	amosbird: and when it does but the resulting package doesn't work, then what?
2018-03-07 23:05:05	Scimmia	!give gnulligan notarch

2018-03-07 23:05:39	nejni-marji	Is it okay to use -Syw && -Syu?
2018-03-07 23:05:59	Scimmia	nejni-marji: sure, but why?
2018-03-07 23:06:07	sheep	yes, if you don't -S something in between the two
2018-03-07 23:06:44	Irishluck83	I just stick to syu
2018-03-07 23:06:49	Irishluck83	nice and simple
2018-03-07 23:06:55	nejni-marji	DLing can take a while, but if it starts installing when I'm not paying attention, some software can occasionally just not load (can't find libraries)
2018-03-07 23:07:13	gnulligan	phrik: I understand, I'm just asking about pacman
2018-03-07 23:07:13	@phrik	gnulligan: BLEEP BLOOP
2018-03-07 23:07:32	sheep	gnulligan: the short answer is not entirely with pacman alone
2018-03-07 23:07:49	NoobAlice	!give gnulligan bot
2018-03-07 23:07:50	@phrik	gnulligan: I'm a bot! ~does the binary solo~ 00001 000011 0000111
2018-03-07 23:07:54	Scimmia	gnulligan: saying you understand, then arging means you don't understand
2018-03-07 23:07:55	sheep	it won't handle changes you need to make to configuration files
2018-03-07 23:08:20	sheep	or cases where two packages conflict, or cases where two different packages have the same name
2018-03-07 23:08:21	gnulligan	ok. I was surprised when I saw that pacman was used for installation so it looks a bit more "powerful" than say apt
2018-03-07 23:08:48	Irishluck83	it is
2018-03-07 23:09:13	Irishluck83	in my experience pacman is one of the most powerful package management
2018-03-07 23:10:00	nejni-marji	I really like pacman. Honestly, it's one of the strongest things keeping me from ever switching
2018-03-07 23:10:43	gnulligan	ok, so basically yes you can completely switch from one arch-based distro to another with pacman, but it will require you to manually handle conflicts and changes to config files
2018-03-07 23:11:20	occultus	i would argue that pacman is *less* powerful than the apt system, which is one of its strengths
2018-03-07 23:14:08	nejni-marji	what do you mean?
2018-03-07 23:15:32	guys	occultus: I don't know what apt is capable of and I consider that to be a personal strength...
2018-03-07 23:15:38	guys	:p
2018-03-07 23:16:08	nejni-marji	I only know apt [install|remove|update && apt upgrade]
2018-03-07 23:16:18	occultus	apt (and dpkg) has a LOT of extra "stuff" built in that happens when you run those commands
2018-03-07 23:16:39	badpixel	hey all. me again. sd card issue. i tried the same steps on centos and when "w" in fdisk /dev/sdb i have and error output. arch doesnt show me that. here is: fdisk: cannot write disk label: Bad file descriptor. so sd card is the problem?
2018-03-07 23:17:22	badpixel	MacGyver: ^
2018-03-07 23:18:04	occultus	packages can have "configuration", they can do more than optionally depend and "recommend" things, apt has a command to autoremove, it will track the config files associated with uninstalled packages, etc.
2018-03-07 23:20:57	guys	occultus: pacman has an autoremove also
2018-03-07 23:21:21	guys	pacman -Qqdt| pacman -Rns
2018-03-07 23:21:25	guys	pacman -Qqdt| pacman -Rns -
2018-03-07 23:21:59	guys	and who cares about config files for uninstalled packages -_-
2018-03-07 23:22:27	Scimmia	yeah, that's one of the more annoying things about debian/apt IMO
2018-03-07 23:22:44	occultus	guys: that's exactly why pacman's lack of features is so nice
2018-03-07 23:23:09	guys	I'm just curious now, what it would even do with them 
2018-03-07 23:23:28	Scimmia	just leaves them there in case you install it again
2018-03-07 23:23:42	Scimmia	even if unmodified, for some unknown reason
2018-03-07 23:24:21	nejni-marji	I wish there was a way to have it remove config files for stuff you don't have installed
2018-03-07 23:24:32	guys	so basically, exactly like pacman except you have no warning that it is for an uninstalled package
2018-03-07 23:24:44	nejni-marji	like pacman -X --remove-unused-configs
2018-03-07 23:24:49	guys	... and except for the fact that unmodified files are safely deleted
2018-03-07 23:24:59	occultus	oh, apt also interactively prompts for the conflict resolution strategy to apply to each 3-way conflict in a config file (the XYZ case that creates .pacnew in pacman)
2018-03-07 23:25:10	guys	nejni-marji: if you uninstall a package, the backup files are moved to *.pacsave
2018-03-07 23:25:16	nejni-marji	is that so
2018-03-07 23:25:36	Irishluck83	yep
2018-03-07 23:25:40	nejni-marji	hm
2018-03-07 23:25:54	nejni-marji	Is this dependent on the package or does it always happen?
2018-03-07 23:26:02	guys	Yes, so if you use some pacdiff program like pacdiffviewer it can trivially find and help you handle all uninstalled configs and pacnew changes
2018-03-07 23:26:13	nejni-marji	wwoah
2018-03-07 23:26:19	nejni-marji	I've never seen pacdiff before
2018-03-07 23:26:23	nejni-marji	whaaaaaat
2018-03-07 23:26:23	guys	... it depends if the file is actually marked as a config file, if not it is simply deleted
2018-03-07 23:27:11	guys	nejni-marji: this is a rather significant feature to be missing, so it is good you know about it now. ;)
2018-03-07 23:27:45	Scimmia	uninstalled configs is simpler, find -name "*.pacnew"
2018-03-07 23:28:11	nejni-marji	is there anything else I should knoww about?
2018-03-07 23:28:11	Scimmia	er, *.pacsave, of course
2018-03-07 23:29:06	nejni-marji	pacdiff is showing me the diff for /etc/hosts, but I don't remember it looking like how it shows the original being when I first edited it
2018-03-07 23:29:30	occultus	pacdiff doesn't know about the "original"
2018-03-07 23:29:41	occultus	(unless it's doing something very sneaky)
2018-03-07 23:29:46	⚡	hringriin_ is now known as hringriin
2018-03-07 23:29:46	Irishluck83	if you touched it then delete the update
2018-03-07 23:29:59	Irishluck83	if you don't touch a config file let it pass
2018-03-07 23:30:21	occultus	the presence of a pacnew means the config file has been touched
2018-03-07 23:30:27	nejni-marji	so pacdiff lets me see the diff between the pacnew and the real file
2018-03-07 23:30:34	guys	nejni-marji: all it can do is compare the current packaged version, to the version you have modified
2018-03-07 23:30:35	nejni-marji	I get it noww
2018-03-07 23:30:40	nejni-marji	man i need to fix my keyboard
2018-03-07 23:30:54	nejni-marji	it's not doing so wwell
2018-03-07 23:31:15	guys	pacdiffviewer (part of yaourt) actually tracks the old versions and offers to apply the diff between them if possible. :)
2018-03-07 23:31:18	Irishluck83	occultus: i mean if you made changes to that config file. then don't let it replace what you did
2018-03-07 23:31:35	guys	pacmarge uses git merging to do much the same thing
2018-03-07 23:31:56	guys	Irishluck83: well, that defeats the purpose of pacnew
2018-03-07 23:32:14	guys	you *want* to see what the packaged version changed, and possibly apply those changes yourself.
2018-03-07 23:33:18	guys	pacdiffviewer is actually pretty nice, it will check to see if the diff between the last changed version in the package can be cleanly applied to your modified file, and then offer to apply that merge
2018-03-07 23:35:02	nejni-marji	"overwrite fstab?"
2018-03-07 23:35:13	nejni-marji	why yes this is what i've always wanted
2018-03-07 23:35:41	guys	nejni-marji: ono
2018-03-07 23:35:53	nejni-marji	i told it not to
2018-03-07 23:35:54	guys	well, that is one of the few files you do *not* want to merge
2018-03-07 23:35:58	nejni-marji	lol
2018-03-07 23:36:14	guys	basically, anything from the filesystem package you should be super careful about 
2018-03-07 23:36:43	Irishluck83	guys: that is what i was trying to get at
2018-03-07 23:36:52	Irishluck83	just said it poorly
2018-03-07 23:37:36	nejni-marji	"overwrite /etc/group?"
2018-03-07 23:37:38	Scimmia	IIRC, the only thing that changed in fstab was the header. You can merge that if you want
2018-03-07 23:37:52	nejni-marji	i mean, i could
2018-03-07 23:37:53	Scimmia	ignore group/passwd/shadow/gshadow
2018-03-07 23:38:04	nejni-marji	I know lol I just find it amusing
2018-03-07 23:38:16	chowbok	That reminds me
2018-03-07 23:38:20	Irishluck83	sudoders file i changed on accident and couldn't sudo after that
2018-03-07 23:38:22	Irishluck83	oops
2018-03-07 23:38:34	chowbok	Is there a way to disable shadowed groups?
2018-03-07 23:41:55	nejni-marji	Irishluck83: that's why you always, always keep an archiso flashdrive around. or a second computer that can make one
2018-03-07 23:42:37	BrainDamage	or you stuff a friend who can fix your computer in a toolbox
2018-03-07 23:42:59	occultus	!grab BrainDamage 
2018-03-07 23:43:00	@phrik	occultus: Bazinga!
2018-03-07 23:43:33	Irishluck83	i fixed it as soon as it happened didn't need to use an iso
2018-03-07 23:43:45	nejni-marji	that's good, then
2018-03-07 23:44:20	occultus	Irishluck83: "couldn't sudo" as in you missed a syntax error because you didn't use visudo, or as in you locked your user out?
2018-03-07 23:44:50	tomty89	Hmm, jdk9 requires jdk8 as a makedep, jdk8 requires jdk7 as a makedep, and jdk7 requires itself as a makedep?
2018-03-07 23:45:25	tomty89	So one can't just build openjdk "from scratch"?
2018-03-07 23:45:30	Irishluck83	locked user out. 
2018-03-07 23:46:02	Scimmia	tomty89: that's pretty common for compilers
2018-03-07 23:46:21	nejni-marji	but how do you compile the first compiler
2018-03-07 23:47:10	occultus	the first java compiler was probably written in C++ or something years ago, after that you can write a java compiler in java
2018-03-07 23:47:57	tomty89	Scimmia: but then why doesn't jdk8 and jdk9 just requires themselves as makedep like jdk9 does?
2018-03-07 23:48:02	tomty89	*jdk7
2018-03-07 23:48:05	Scimmia	no idea
2018-03-07 23:48:14	Scimmia	simplicity, probably
2018-03-07 23:48:32	Scimmia	a whole lot easier when you don't have to bootstrap it
2018-03-07 23:49:24	▷	tomty89 shivers
2018-03-07 23:51:44	catbehemoth	I am trying to set up libvirt with UEFI I followed the wiki installed ovmf added the nvram = line, restarted libvirtd and I still get Error: --boot uefi: Did not find any UEFI binary path for arch 'x86_64' can anyone help?
