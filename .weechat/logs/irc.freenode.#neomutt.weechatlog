2018-03-06 03:28:47	minikdo_	Hi, I run neomutt 1.7.2-1 on debian and I get pgp_self_encrypt: unknown variable and pgp_default_key: unknown variable
2018-03-06 03:30:57	minikdo_	NeoMutt 20170113 (1.7.2) with patch-encrypt-to-self-neomutt
2018-03-06 03:34:18	gahr	minikdo_: hi.. let me double check, but I think the self_encrypt was added later
2018-03-06 03:34:30	gahr	https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commit/2c51035979c527a79ee90a619e77be5c9a3cc796
2018-03-06 03:34:50	gahr	the first release to have it was neomutt-20170602
2018-03-06 03:35:14	minikdo_	gahr: check this out https://www.neomutt.org/feature/encrypt-to-self
2018-03-06 03:37:19	minikdo_	it says: Since: NeoMutt 2016-07-23
2018-03-06 03:39:28	gahr	it's wrong
2018-03-06 03:40:11	minikdo_	gahr: I see
2018-03-06 03:40:15	minikdo_	thanks
2018-03-06 03:41:20	gahr	there might have been an encrypt-to-self patch earlier, but it's changed
2018-03-06 03:41:41	gahr	for sure the pgp_self_encrypt variable was introduced here : https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commit/2c51035979c527a79ee90a619e77be5c9a3cc796
2018-03-06 03:42:04	gahr	flatcap will sure be able to provide more insight, in a few hours
2018-03-06 03:42:12	minikdo_	ok, weird if I type mutt -v I get: patch-encrypt-to-self-neomutt
2018-03-06 03:42:42	gahr	ok I don't know much about patches
2018-03-06 03:42:48	minikdo_	ok, thanks
2018-03-06 03:43:21	gahr	even less about how debian packages mutt/neomutt/patches
2018-03-06 03:43:22	gahr	:)

2018-03-06 20:15:40	tecepe	since i'm making lots of questions today, here you have one more: i used to have the "empty_subject" configuration in my muttrc, but some time ago (some months ago to be honest...) it started to give me an error "empty_subject: unknown variable". I believe this is a problem in my side, is that true?
2018-03-06 20:32:22	SvenG	tecepe: grep empty_subject init.h
2018-03-06 20:33:22	SvenG	tecepe: neomutt -D | grep empty_subject
2018-03-06 20:33:41	SvenG	tecepe: NeoMutt 20180223
2018-03-06 20:33:53	SvenG	tecepe: neomutt -v | head -1
2018-03-06 21:20:04	flatcap	tecepe: "empty_subject" only exists in neomutt and only since neomutt-20170128
2018-03-06 21:23:47	tecepe	sorry, guys, i was in a call
2018-03-06 21:24:39	tecepe	so, yes, it used to work. but something happened... i believe it is so install conflict. i'm using ubuntu 16.04 (lts)
2018-03-06 21:25:32	tecepe	and I remember installing neomutt somehow, because i wanted the new features (empty_subject was one of the most important)
2018-03-06 21:26:03	tecepe	but i can't recall how i managed to install neomutt
2018-03-06 21:26:10	tecepe	is it available in a ppa?
2018-03-06 21:27:26	flatcap	no idea, sorry
2018-03-06 21:27:31	tecepe	i guess i'm not running neomutt anymore
2018-03-06 21:28:09	tecepe	probably the traditional mutt package was upgraded and took the place from neomutt again because it was "newer"
2018-03-06 21:30:32	flatcap	it's in debian experimental, but I don't know how/if that fits into ubuntu
2018-03-06 21:32:10	tecepe	right. i will try to figure out how i had it installed before. if i find it out i come back
2018-03-06 21:33:53	flatcap	ok.  we could do with some instructions for ubuntu
2018-03-06 21:36:55	tecepe	ok, here what happened
2018-03-06 21:37:12	tecepe	i got neomutt from a ppa backport
2018-03-06 21:37:14	tecepe	ppa:jonathonf/backports
2018-03-06 21:37:52	flatcap	ah, ok
2018-03-06 21:38:12	tecepe	but this guy started to back port the traditional mutt instead of neomutt for some reason
2018-03-06 21:38:29	tecepe	as you can see here https://launchpad.net/~jonathonf/+archive/ubuntu/backports/+sourcepub/8578218/+listing-archive-extra
2018-03-06 21:38:50	tecepe	from mutt (1.8.3+neomutt20170609-2) unstable; urgency=medium to mutt (1.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium
2018-03-06 21:39:47	flatcap	ah, that sounds familiar. it's because debian changed from the "mutt" package being neomutt, to "mutt" being vanilla mutt
2018-03-06 21:41:20	tecepe	ah, i see. so confusing
2018-03-06 21:41:48	tecepe	now will both be on the repository?
2018-03-06 21:42:35	flatcap	yes, neomutt's working its way towards stable (I think)
2018-03-06 21:43:37	tecepe	ok, thanks. now everything makes sense
2018-03-06 21:43:53	tecepe	i was questioning myself already
2018-03-06 21:43:54	tecepe	hahaha
2018-03-06 21:44:51	tecepe	what is the procedure to install neomutt? only compiling it myself?
2018-03-06 21:46:51	flatcap	if you really can't find a compatible binary, then yes -- https://www.neomutt.org/dev/build
2018-03-06 21:47:44	flatcap	you'll need to install quite a few deps
2018-03-06 21:52:22	tecepe	I'll try the gnu guix thing
2018-03-06 21:52:28	tecepe	let's see
2018-03-06 21:52:38	tecepe	(unless you tell me to not)
2018-03-06 21:53:26	flatcap	that's a distro about which I understand even less than debian
2018-03-06 21:55:26	tecepe	hehe as i understand, guix is only a package manager
2018-03-06 21:55:59	flatcap	I see
2018-03-06 22:04:04	tecepe	so, guixsd is a distro "guix system distribution"

2018-03-07 19:41:30	⚡	icke23 is now known as SvenG
2018-03-07 23:07:43	Evidlo	for some reason a lot of messages that I've read are marked as unread next time I open neomutt
2018-03-07 23:37:33	SvenG	Evidlo: have you left the folder with 'x'? are you using imap?
2018-03-07 23:45:41	Evidlo	SvenG: I'm using imap.  I leave the message using the 'exit' command
2018-03-07 23:45:43	Evidlo	which is mapped to a key
2018-03-07 23:46:39	SvenG	Evidlo: "exit" does not update the folder. changes, like "reading", are not saved. feature. :-P
2018-03-07 23:46:58	SvenG	Evidlo: i suggest you use 'q' (quit) instead.
2018-03-07 23:47:46	SvenG	q | quit | save changes to mailbox and quit
2018-03-07 23:48:31	Evidlo	how do I leave the pager and go back to the index?
2018-03-07 23:49:00	SvenG	'q'
2018-03-07 23:49:02	Valeyard	q
2018-03-07 23:49:14	Evidlo	I mean is there a way to save when I exit the pager
2018-03-07 23:49:40	SvenG	no.. from the pager you exit back into the index menu
2018-03-07 23:50:15	SvenG	index -> pager -> index
2018-03-07 23:50:39	Evidlo	could I do 'macro pager q "exit;save"' ?
2018-03-07 23:50:45	SvenG	index -> pager (exit) -> index (exit/quit)
2018-03-07 23:51:15	SvenG	Evidlo: you could. but.. every time? really??
2018-03-07 23:51:58	SvenG	-> macro pager q <exit><sync-mailbox>
2018-03-07 23:52:41	SvenG	i'd rather hit '$' to sync-mailbox when i'm sure i want an update
2018-03-07 23:53:00	SvenG	and it happens anyway when i switch to another mailbox
2018-03-07 23:53:19	SvenG	.. or when i "quit" from the folder index menu
2018-03-08 00:02:33	Evidlo	the save operation seems pretty fast, so I dont notice it
2018-03-08 00:28:33	SvenG	well.. where do you save that message to then?
2018-03-08 00:30:47	SvenG	"save" as such does not exist as a command. however, "save-message" does.  but that only saves the current messages to another folder. (special case: saves it to the same folder)
2018-03-08 00:32:23	SvenG	in that special case you'll produce duplicates
