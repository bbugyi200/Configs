2018-03-06 03:47:57	marens	hey there, are there known focus problems when using multiple windows in Full layout in combination with a floating  window? e.g. i have a workspace with two terminals (t1, t2, spawned in that order on that workspace) set to Full Layout (t1 is currently shown) and add a xclock that is set to float via my manage hook. now when switching the focus via mouse to the xclock the the shown terminal will automatically change from t1 to t2. Adding another
2018-03-06 03:47:57	marens	terminal t3 will cause t3 to be shown when moving the focus via mouse to xclock, so it seems  that always the last spawned window gets to be shoen in the full layout. Using xmonad 0.13-6 here
2018-03-06 03:50:48	marens	config is https://pastebin.com/gxBmjqhM
2018-03-06 03:57:09	ongy	floats have weird interactions with the viewset. They are part of the viewset, but not in the layout. So focus moves to the float and the layout gets confused :/
2018-03-06 03:58:26	marens	hm, any known workarounds?

2018-03-07 00:17:26	bbugyi200	Sorry. What I meant to ask was this: is there anyway to open a window to a specific size by default based on its classname?
2018-03-07 00:22:28	Lears	bbugyi200: You can compose into your managehook an entry like className =? "something" --> doRectFloat (RationalRect a b c d), where doRectFloat is imported from XMonad.Hooks.ManageHelpers.
2018-03-07 00:27:14	bbugyi200	Awesome. Thanks for the help man. That's exactly what I was looking for.

2018-03-07 22:32:27	maddybutt	I use NamedScratchpads a lot, and I have them configured almost perfectly for me, but I can't figure out how to make a binding which will hide the currently focused scratchpad no matter what it is - anyone have any idea how I could do that?
2018-03-07 22:32:42	maddybutt	Here's the relevant parts of my config:
2018-03-07 22:32:44	maddybutt	https://github.com/b0o/xmonad-conf/blob/master/lib/Conf/NamedScratchpads.hs
2018-03-07 22:32:48	maddybutt	https://github.com/b0o/xmonad-conf/blob/master/lib/Conf/Bindings/Keys/Launchers.hs#L53
2018-03-07 22:34:01	geekosaur	you're overthinking it. withFocused $ windows . doShift "NSP"
2018-03-07 22:34:31	maddybutt	Then i could accidentally shift a non-scratchpad window to NSP though
2018-03-07 22:34:51	geekosaur	whose downside is that it will also in effect turn the current window into a scratchpad without a name (therefore inaccessible) if it's *not* a NamedScratchpad --- but there's no good way to avoid that
2018-03-07 22:34:53	geekosaur	yeh
2018-03-07 22:35:07	maddybutt	I guess it's better than nothing though
2018-03-07 22:35:18	fizzie	Run through the NS list and apply each of the queries, do ^ if there's a match?
2018-03-07 22:35:39	geekosaur	problem is the only way to avoid it is to iterate through the NS definitions running their queries against the current window and only do the shift if one of them matches
2018-03-07 22:35:43	geekosaur	ye
2018-03-07 22:36:03	maddybutt	I'll try that, my haskell is pretty rusty atm though :p
2018-03-07 22:36:14	geekosaur	but it's a potentially expensive way to do things, if you have as many as I do. I do a bit of scrambling in Loggers.NSP to try to avoid that
2018-03-07 22:38:38	geekosaur	sometimes I think we need a mechanism to tag windows for this kind of thing, either in the StackSet (which potentially has compatibility issues) or via window props (potentially expensive)
2018-03-07 23:09:19	maddybutt	@geekosaur: `withFocused $ windows . doShift "NSP"` - are you sure that's right? I'm getting a compilation error that too many arguments are being applied to doShift
2018-03-07 23:09:19	+lambdabot	Unknown command, try @list
2018-03-07 23:18:56	geekosaur	sorry, W.shift
2018-03-07 23:19:12	geekosaur	which implies 'import qualified XMonad.StackSet as W'
2018-03-07 23:20:55	maddybutt	So:  XMonad.withFocused $ XMonad.windows . StackSet.shift "NSP"
2018-03-07 23:21:06	maddybutt	Which still doesn't compile
2018-03-07 23:21:19	maddybutt	Sorry, it's been a few months since I've touched haskell
2018-03-07 23:21:28	geekosaur	withFocused $ windows . W.shift "NSP"
2018-03-07 23:21:29	Lears	"NSP" is argument to the composition, not shift.
2018-03-07 23:21:56	Lears	And I'm fairly sure you don't need withFocused either
2018-03-07 23:22:01	geekosaur	or if you didn't "as" it, it'd be XMonad.StackSet.shift instead of W.shift
2018-03-07 23:22:10	geekosaur	if it's a keybinding, that's how you get the focused window
2018-03-07 23:22:24	geekosaur	only mouse bindings get a target window automatically
2018-03-07 23:26:27	maddybutt	("M-S-?", addName "Move to NSP"   $ XMonad.withFocused $ XMonad.windows . StackSet.shift "NSP")
2018-03-07 23:26:33	maddybutt	https://gist.github.com/761d04ec64c4f21e89a3cb85bc827ca5
2018-03-07 23:26:56	Lears	In this case W.shift uses W.peek to get the focus, geekosaur.
2018-03-07 23:27:37	geekosaur	hm, right, I keep forgetting the difference between shift and shiftWin :(
2018-03-07 23:27:39	Lears	maddybutt: `windows . W.shift $ "NSP"` should work.
2018-03-07 23:28:05	geekosaur	(rather I keep expecting shift to *be* shiftWin
2018-03-07 23:30:06	maddybutt	Lears: That worked :)
2018-03-07 23:30:13	maddybutt	Thanks both of you for your help
2018-03-08 00:13:31	s2mitrov	hey, i just installed xmonad (on nixOS) and set up a super basic xmonad.hs; literally all I've got in the main is setting the terminal to urxvt. Mod-Q after editing doesn't produce any errors, but when I reboot my VM Mod-Shift-Enter no longer works (tried ctrl, alt, super, etc. - no combination with shift-enter works)
2018-03-08 00:13:58	s2mitrov	do I need to set a new key combination somewhere that launches urxvt with mod-shift-enter instead of xterm?
2018-03-08 00:15:59	geekosaur	you migth need to make sure $PATH is set properly. most display managers give you a system default path that won't include nix
2018-03-08 00:16:19	s2mitrov	nevermind, i'm just an idiot
2018-03-08 00:16:54	s2mitrov	i added urxvtd to my nix config, but forgot to add the actual rxvt_unicode package
