2018-03-05 15:08:09	blackk	which leads to 1 or 0 mod 4
2018-03-05 15:08:22	neiluj	Hello. I'm trying to show that the vectors 1, sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are linearly independent in a vector space over the rationals
2018-03-05 15:08:32	blackk	ah
2018-03-05 15:08:44	blackk	my favourite linear algebra problem
2018-03-05 15:09:14	Millennial	https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1803809/326053
2018-03-05 15:09:14	neiluj	so I want to show that the unique solution to the equation lambda*1+mu*sqrt(2)+gamma*sqrt(3)=0 is lambda=mu=gamma=0
2018-03-05 15:09:24	Millennial	it has the benefit of being my own answer
2018-03-05 15:09:37	neiluj	oh that's nice
2018-03-05 15:09:42	blackk	yes you can prove it for all square root of primes
2018-03-05 15:10:03	blackk	then you prove that R is an infinite dimensional Q vector space
2018-03-05 15:10:16	Millennial	blackk: i don't think you need this to prove that R is an infinite dimensional Q vector space
2018-03-05 15:10:18	Millennial	lol
2018-03-05 15:10:23	neiluj	I was trying to show that the only two solutions over the reals were constants equal to 0 or lambda=-2, mu=1/sqrt(2)...
2018-03-05 15:10:35	neiluj	so over Q we have a unique solution
2018-03-05 15:10:48	newpy	oh I think I get it now
2018-03-05 15:10:49	blackk	how do you proceed?
2018-03-05 15:10:56	blackk	you use cardinality
2018-03-05 15:11:21	blackk	there is a proof of that using logarithms
2018-03-05 15:11:22	Millennial	blackk: for distinct primes p_i \in Z, it's trivial to show that log(p_i) are all linearly independent over Q
2018-03-05 15:11:23	Millennial	yeah
2018-03-05 15:11:32	Millennial	it's just the fundamental theorem of arithmetic
2018-03-05 15:12:05	Millennial	but the cardinality argument is better because in fact R is a |R| dimensional Q-vector space
2018-03-05 15:12:07	newpy	x1y2 = y1x2 just means y2/x2 = y1/x1 ie. they have the same slope relative to B
2018-03-05 15:12:11	Millennial	which these arguments do not prove
2018-03-05 15:12:28	neiluj	Millennial: your answer uses Galois groups
2018-03-05 15:12:31	Millennial	neiluj: yes
2018-03-05 15:12:39	Millennial	:o
2018-03-05 15:12:41	neiluj	can I understand it without them?
2018-03-05 15:12:45	Millennial	my answer? no
2018-03-05 15:12:51	Millennial	but you can solve your problem without them
2018-03-05 15:12:53	neiluj	your proof I mean
2018-03-05 15:12:57	Millennial	no
2018-03-05 15:13:13	Millennial	you need to know what the field trace is, if you know that the proof is trivial
2018-03-05 15:13:26	neiluj	I know that!
2018-03-05 15:13:33	Millennial	and you need to know some properties of the field trace which are a bit of a pain to prove without galois theory
2018-03-05 15:13:41	neiluj	the trace of a matrix though
2018-03-05 15:13:44	Millennial	like the transitivity of the field trace over field towers
2018-03-05 15:14:02	blackk	you dont need galois theory to prove transitivity
2018-03-05 15:14:07	Millennial	blackk: you don't need to
2018-03-05 15:14:11	Millennial	but it's painful to do it without
2018-03-05 15:14:16	Millennial	with galois theory it's trivial
2018-03-05 15:14:25	⚡	HellCat is now known as Panther
2018-03-05 15:14:26	Millennial	without, you need to write out the matrices
2018-03-05 15:14:32	Millennial	and actually compute the trace
2018-03-05 15:14:36	blackk	why is it painful it just two matrices
2018-03-05 15:14:43	Millennial	blackk: but the matrices are big
2018-03-05 15:14:45	Millennial	:(
2018-03-05 15:14:55	⚡	Guest8947 is now known as Victor
2018-03-05 15:14:55	blackk	Im not even sure if you need to write them down
2018-03-05 15:15:08	neiluj	but in my particular example, I'm correct if I show that they are only two solutions for my equation over the reals hence one over the rationals?
2018-03-05 15:15:25	Millennial	neiluj: there aren't only two solutions to c_0 + c_1 sqrt(2) + c_2 sqrt(3) = 0 over the reals
2018-03-05 15:15:48	Millennial	there are |R| many solution triples (c_0, c_1, c_2)
2018-03-05 15:15:50	Millennial	so you're not correct
2018-03-05 15:15:58	neiluj	oh that's right
2018-03-05 15:15:58	blackk	there infinite solution
2018-03-05 15:16:08	blackk	you have several degree of freedom
2018-03-05 15:16:11	blackk	2
2018-03-05 15:16:23	neiluj	indeed I overlooked this
2018-03-05 15:16:57	newpy	prove sqrt((x_1)^2 + (y_1)^2) + sqrt((x_2)^2 + (y_2)^2) = sqrt((x_1 + x_2)^2 + (y_1 + y_2)^2)
2018-03-05 15:16:58	neiluj	I'm wondering how I could prove there is only one solution over Q
2018-03-05 15:17:11	newpy	where x_1 * y_2 = y_1 * x_2
2018-03-05 15:17:13	neiluj	it looks obvious to me but I can't prove it
2018-03-05 15:17:26	blackk	I really would go for the easiest proof using logarithms
2018-03-05 15:20:27	Millennial	newpy: square both sides, expand the squares on the RHS, you're left with sqrt((x_1 x_2)^2 + (y_1 y_2)^2 + (x_1 y_2)^2 + (x_2 y_1)^2) = x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2
2018-03-05 15:20:34	Millennial	now use the information you're given
2018-03-05 15:22:32	newpy	Millenial, so if I square the RHS I see (x1 + x2)^2 + (y1 + y2)^2 -> x1^2 + 2x1x2 + x2^2 + y1^2 + 2y1y2 + y2^2

2018-03-05 15:25:55	newpy	(x1^2 + y1^2)(x2^2+y2^2) = (x1x2 + y1y2)^2
2018-03-05 15:26:36	unyu	Now expand, obviously.
2018-03-05 15:28:04	newpy	x1^2*x2^2 + y2^2*x1^2 + y1^2*x2^2 + y1^2*y2^2 = x1^2*x2^2 + 2x1x2y1y2 + y1^2*y2^2
2018-03-05 15:28:25	unyu	Eliminate common terms from both sides.
2018-03-05 15:28:45	newpy	y2^2*x1^2 + y1^2*x2^2 = 2x1x2y1y2
2018-03-05 15:28:45	unyu	And use what your original hypothesis to rewrite the left-hand side.
2018-03-05 15:28:48	blackk	Im not sure if you two are having fun here
2018-03-05 15:29:15	unyu	blackk: I'm giving orders, like a boss.
2018-03-05 15:29:25	unyu	It's only mildly fun, though.
2018-03-05 15:29:54	newpy	so b/c x1y2 = x2y1
2018-03-05 15:30:10	newpy	the LHS = 2x the same term
2018-03-05 15:30:22	newpy	and the RHS = 2 * the same term squared?
2018-03-05 15:30:33	newpy	err
2018-03-05 15:30:38	newpy	LHS = 2x th esame term squared as well
2018-03-05 15:30:41	unyu	In the left-hand side, you have this:
2018-03-05 15:31:04	unyu	(x1^2 * y2^2) + (y1^2 * x2^2), right?
2018-03-05 15:31:15	newpy	if I say z = x1y2 = x2y1, then now 2z^2 = 2z^2
2018-03-05 15:31:21	newpy	right
2018-03-05 15:31:24	unyu	Yep.
2018-03-05 15:31:50	newpy	so when Millenial said: "you're left with sqrt((x_1 x_2)^2 + (y_1 y_2)^2 + (x_1 y_2)^2 + (x_2 y_1)^2) = x_1 x_2 + y_1 y_2"

2018-03-05 15:32:24	newpy	which step did he skip to
2018-03-05 15:32:27	unyu	I would've renamed the variables to a,b,c,d long ago.
2018-03-05 15:32:39	newpy	unyu, haha I did wayyyy up when no one was replying
2018-03-05 15:32:44	unyu	lol
2018-03-05 15:32:52	newpy	but then reverted to x_1 etc b/c I wasn't sure if it was relevant to the problem somehow
2018-03-05 15:32:57	blackk	oh you just used the fact that trace of sums is sums of traces
2018-03-05 15:32:57	newpy	for people to know they were coordinates etc
2018-03-05 15:33:07	newpy	blackk I have no idea what you mean
2018-03-05 15:33:24	blackk	Im looking at the math.stackexchange link Millenial provided
2018-03-05 15:33:30	newpy	oh
2018-03-05 15:35:12	newpy	so if I want to show this is equivalent to geometric line segments, AB + BC = AC, with only the distance formula and suitably named coordinates
2018-03-05 15:35:18	newpy	how would I go about it?
2018-03-05 15:35:30	blackk	you changed topic?
2018-03-05 15:35:38	newpy	it says Hint: it is convenient to let B be the origin
2018-03-05 15:36:10	newpy	blackk: no I want to show that AB + BC = AC is equivalent to sqrt(a^2 + b^2) + sqrt(c^2 + d^2) = sqrt((a+c)^2 + (b+d)^2)
2018-03-05 15:36:39	newpy	(I replaced x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 with a,b,c,d like unyu said)
2018-03-05 15:36:49	blackk	ok lets do that
2018-03-05 15:37:00	blackk	A=(a,b), B=(0,0)
2018-03-05 15:37:07	blackk	C=(c,d)
2018-03-05 15:37:27	blackk	so what is AC ?
2018-03-05 15:37:35	blackk	(c-a,d-b)
2018-03-05 15:37:38	newpy	(c-a,d-b)

2018-03-05 15:38:54	newpy	blackk, I know what you mean
2018-03-05 15:38:56	newpy	AC isn't a point

2018-03-05 15:41:55	newpy	BC = sqrt(-c^2 - d^2)
2018-03-05 15:42:10	blackk	-_-
2018-03-05 15:42:11	blackk	no
2018-03-05 15:42:17	blackk	you square (-c)
2018-03-05 15:42:20	blackk	which is c^2
2018-03-05 15:42:25	blackk	and (-d) which is d^2
2018-03-05 15:42:35	newpy	BC = sqrt(c^2 + d^2)
2018-03-05 15:42:39	blackk	yeah
2018-03-05 15:43:04	blackk	afk
2018-03-05 15:56:15	Aleric	Hello, can someone help me with this problem (not for school, I really need it ;):  Consider the map from the integers (i) to "the number of zeroes that that integer ends on when written in binary form" (f(i)). For example f(i) = 0 when i is odd, f(i) = f(i / 2) + 1 when i is even.
2018-03-05 15:56:59	Millennial	Aleric: what's the problem
2018-03-05 15:57:02	Aleric	Let g(i) be the sum for j=1...i of f(j).  Is there a way to write g(i) in a simple formula?
2018-03-05 15:57:36	Aleric	What I really need, actually, is the inverse of g(i)... so, given g(i), what is i.
2018-03-05 15:57:42	unyu	Aleric: Consider how many numbers “i” with “g(i) = k” there should be in your range.
2018-03-05 15:58:05	unyu	For any fixed natural number “k”.
2018-03-05 15:58:41	Aleric	i / 2^k  ?
2018-03-05 15:59:19	unyu	Errr, sorry, I meant “with f(i) = k”.
2018-03-05 15:59:37	Aleric	Well, that's what I tried to answer :p
2018-03-05 16:01:22	Aleric	Hmm, more like  i / 2^(k + 1)
2018-03-05 16:03:46	Aleric	lets say, k = 0 .. then the number of j in the range [1, i] for which f(j) = k = 0 is the number of odd numbers in that range. So, i=1 --> 1, i=2 --> 1, i=3 --> 2... So in general (i+1)/2.
2018-03-05 16:06:11	spear2	is there something online to find closed forms of series?
2018-03-05 16:07:05	Dodek	wolfram alpha sometimes can do it
2018-03-05 16:07:27	Dodek	but few series have closed forms, and there's no algorithmic way to compute them anyway
2018-03-05 16:07:44	Aleric	If k=1, then the number of j in the range [1, i] for which f(j) = k = 1, is the number of numbers that are an odd multiple of 2 in that range. So, i=1 --> 0, i=2 --> 1, i=3 --> 1, i=4 --> 1, i=5 --> 1, i=6 --> 2, i=7 --> 2, i=8 --> 2, .. etc... so yeah, every 4.  So in general (i+2)/4
2018-03-05 16:08:14	spear2	curious about the series 1 - 1/2 + 1/4 - 1/6 + 1/8 ...
2018-03-05 16:08:44	spear2	basically the series 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 ... = pi/4, except with even numbers instead of odd
2018-03-05 16:09:04	spear2	~0.65342
2018-03-05 16:09:23	Aleric	spear2: that seems related to my question
2018-03-05 16:09:27	ringstuff	Aleric: f is sometimes called the ruler function. f(n) is (obviously) the largest k so that 2^k divides n. there is an easy way to evaluate the sum f(1) + ... + f(n), which is exactly what you're going to find
2018-03-05 16:09:35	ringstuff	see "Legendre's formula"
2018-03-05 16:10:34	joel135	spear2: it is related to ln(2)
2018-03-05 16:11:20	joel135	0.653426409720027
2018-03-05 16:12:28	ringstuff	restricted to the base 2 case, you get f(1) + ... + f(n) ( = f(n!) = ) floor(n) + floor(n/2) + ... + floor(n/2^k) + ... = n minus the sum of digits of n in base 2
2018-03-05 16:13:35	Z-module	spear2: subtract 1 from that and divide by -2, and you are left with a famous series
2018-03-05 16:13:57	Z-module	also, you might not have really meant the 1 term there to begin with, it doesn't "fit the pattern"
2018-03-05 16:14:17	Aleric	Why is f(1) + ... + f(n) = f(n!) ?
2018-03-05 16:14:17	spear2	joel135: i get 0.69314 for ln(2)
2018-03-05 16:14:24	Aleric	isn't n! n factorial?
2018-03-05 16:14:45	ringstuff	indeed, and f(ab) = f(a) + f(b)
2018-03-05 16:14:58	Aleric	Ah... yeah, makes sense.
2018-03-05 16:15:29	spear2	Z-module: true, i just did that to match the pi/4 series
2018-03-05 16:17:00	ringstuff	Aleric: there should be a clever algorithm to look for inverses using the last expression I mentioned
2018-03-05 16:18:29	Aleric	Thanks :), I'm going to play with this in a program (I need it for a computer program.. hence that it needs to be super simple; cause I want to be able to do the conversion in mere clock cycles)
2018-03-05 16:20:20	spear2	Z-module: ah if i remove the 1 and start with +1/2 it's equal to (ln 2)/2
2018-03-05 16:21:53	linux_dream	hello.  assume i have a sequence of 0's and 1's that contain some information.  my question is whether applying a function to each element such that it returns 0 or 1 at random with 50% probability erases the information of the original sequence in a worse way than if I apply the function more than 1 time in a row
2018-03-05 16:22:54	a____ptr	Where should I look if I want to get the general "shape" of matrix rings? (Over R, say.)
2018-03-05 16:22:54	Dodek	linux_dream: what do you mean by "applying a function"? how does the original sequence affect the result?
2018-03-05 16:23:19	ringstuff	Aleric: in the worst case to calculate the inverse, you can perform one simple arithmetic operation and comparison for each bit in your integer
2018-03-05 16:23:26	Dodek	a____ptr: artin-wedderburn theorem?
2018-03-05 16:23:43	drdo	linux_dream: Well, your function has no relation to the original sequence, it's just a random sequence of bits
2018-03-05 16:23:49	a____ptr	Oh I was more looking for general "subject" heading
2018-03-05 16:23:50	drdo	*the output of your "function"
2018-03-05 16:23:53	a____ptr	Thx tho
2018-03-05 16:24:42	Dodek	a____ptr: but seems like it might not be what you want; artin-wedderburn theorem says that semisimple rings are in particular matrix rings withvery specific structure
2018-03-05 16:24:58	linux_dream	that's what I thought drdo thanks.  then i wonder why programs that erase data on hard disk run several times in a row a program to write 0's and 1's if one time is enough to destroy all information of the original data
2018-03-05 16:25:27	drdo	linux_dream: Probably because of physical properties of disks
2018-03-05 16:25:48	Dodek	linux_dream: there's little reason to do it, nowadays
2018-03-05 16:25:57	a____ptr	Dodek: yeah, I was more wondering about the overall "topology" of GL_n(R) or w/e
2018-03-05 16:26:18	ringstuff	technically this is a subset sum problem; find 0/1 x_1 ... x_n so that (2^n - 1) x_n + (2^{n-1} - 1) x_{n-1} + ... + x_1 = y; but we have the condition that the sum is increasing as 2^n x_n + ... + 2 x_1 increases
2018-03-05 16:26:28	a____ptr	Also I'd imagine they'd introduce me to a good number of example of topogical space too
2018-03-05 16:26:46	Dodek	linux_dream: on some very old disks, some people claimed that you could read some of the erased bits by looking at the magnetization of the areas _around_ the actual area where the writer heads flips the bits
2018-03-05 16:27:03	Z-module	spear2: right
2018-03-05 16:27:27	Dodek	linux_dream: but i haven't heard of people practically extracting information that way, and in any case with extreme data density these days, it doesn't seem viable any longer anyway.
2018-03-05 16:27:43	linux_dream	i see, thanks Dodek
2018-03-05 16:28:14	Dodek	linux_dream: overwriting once is fine. the only problem with that it is that it won't delete data from bad sector, and maybe some weird caches
2018-03-05 16:28:33	drdo	burn, burn it all
2018-03-05 16:28:36	linux_dream	can the data from bad sector be recovered
2018-03-05 16:29:05	Dodek	linux_dream: that's why most large providers have procedures, like, first overwrite disk with random data, then demagentize it with Huge Ass Magnet, and then literally shred it
2018-03-05 16:29:19	Dodek	shredding disks is fun.
2018-03-05 16:29:25	anybus	DBAN ftw
2018-03-05 16:30:13	drdo	Dodek: I find it funny that they bother with the first step
2018-03-05 16:30:57	Dodek	drdo: it's fast and easy, why wouldn't you just do it
2018-03-05 16:31:06	Dodek	well it's less fast these days
2018-03-05 16:31:31	Dodek	but usually you have decomissioning planned in advance, and can just do it overnight a few days prior
2018-03-05 16:31:37	linux_dream	i would just scratch the disk all around
2018-03-05 16:31:45	ringstuff	some companies don't even want the resultant shredded disks to be recycled
2018-03-05 16:31:56	drdo	ringstuff: Now surely that's just silly
2018-03-05 16:31:58	Dodek	linux_dream: that will work fine for scrubs like you an dme
2018-03-05 16:32:32	Dodek	but good technicians would be able to put those scratched plates in special harnesses and recover _some_ data
2018-03-05 16:32:42	ringstuff	there have been scandals about employees  selling such material for scrap against regulations
2018-03-05 16:33:11	Dodek	there are usually policies against _reusing_ decomissioned hard drives, that is, reselling them after wiping
2018-03-05 16:33:24	Dodek	but i haven't heard about policies against recycling scrap.
2018-03-05 16:33:28	Z-module	"Overwrite the disk with freenote ##math logs... malefactors will gain illicit access to the disk, see this material, and run shrieking in horror..."
2018-03-05 16:33:35	Dodek	but i wouldn't be surprised really
2018-03-05 16:33:38	Z-module	Freenode*
2018-03-05 16:33:47	drdo	Just melt the damn disk into a nice homogeneous liquid
2018-03-05 16:33:54	drdo	Good luck recovering from that
2018-03-05 16:37:13	Vince_	hello
2018-03-05 16:37:27	drdo	hey
2018-03-05 16:37:50	Vince_	I'm making a video game in Unreal Engines and Im stuck at a math problem. I was wondering if someone could help me out potentially :D
2018-03-05 16:38:15	drdo	don't ask to ask
2018-03-05 16:38:43	Vince_	So I have a spaceship that travels in a linear direction. I have a planet that has an orbit and speed.
2018-03-05 16:39:03	Aleric	ringstuff: It's not working for me...
2018-03-05 16:39:05	Vince_	I need to calculate what is the best optimal location for the spaceship to reach the planet
2018-03-05 16:39:12	Vince_	in the less amount of days
2018-03-05 16:39:55	Aleric	ringstuff: f(1) = 0, right?  It doesn't end on zeroes.
2018-03-05 16:40:11	Aleric	f(1) = floor(1) = 1 ... so wrong already
2018-03-05 16:41:02	Vince_	:)
2018-03-05 16:41:15	ringstuff	Aleric: oops, the sum should start with floor(n/p)
2018-03-05 16:41:24	Aleric	ok
2018-03-05 16:42:02	Aleric	ok, sum of floors works now.
2018-03-05 16:42:08	koro	Vince_: a circular orbit?
2018-03-05 16:42:16	Vince_	yeah!
2018-03-05 16:42:25	Vince_	easier the better :)
2018-03-05 16:42:47	koro	so write down the formula for the distance, as a function of time
2018-03-05 16:43:38	Vince_	sorry im an artists so my math skills arent amazing
2018-03-05 16:43:41	Vince_	:'(
2018-03-05 16:44:13	probs	Is there a way to prove that for all odd integers n, n^2 is always odd, as long as I can't define an odd number as 2k+1 where k is any integer?
2018-03-05 16:44:30	Z-module	then how do you define odd?
2018-03-05 16:44:59	koro	Vince_: wait... you want the optimal *location* of the ship?
2018-03-05 16:45:11	Hi	Hello?
2018-03-05 16:45:24	Z-module	If you know that a prime p divides ab iff it either divides a or divides b, then you can do it by contradicition. Say n^2 is even. So the prime 2 divides n*n.  So.....
2018-03-05 16:45:29	⚡	Hi is now known as Guest66745
2018-03-05 16:45:29	ringstuff	the usual definition is that a number is odd when (n^n + 1) is a multiple of n + 1
2018-03-05 16:45:30	probs	I would know how to prove it if I were able to use that but because I'm not allowed to, I'm only able to use these 'assumptions' in my book
2018-03-05 16:45:30	koro	Vince_: i'd say that the optimal location is ON the planet...
2018-03-05 16:45:31	Vince_	yeah like the ship should travel to (x,y) on grid because the planet will be there in xDays
2018-03-05 16:45:32	probs	https://imgur.com/a/f8MD8
2018-03-05 16:46:01	Guest66745	Fuck you people
2018-03-05 16:46:02	koro	Vince_: ah, so you have the given position of the ship and planet, and you want to know the direction and speed to travel?
2018-03-05 16:46:07	Guest66745	No
2018-03-05 16:46:20	probs	however I can't really see how those assumptions help me in any way so I was maybe trying to find a way to say, possibly if it's true, that any odd number multiplied by another odd number is odd
2018-03-05 16:46:20	Guest66745	Figure it out dumbass
2018-03-05 16:46:26	Vince_	yes! or rather the Location where the planet will be?
2018-03-05 16:46:33	Aleric	ringstuff: the = n minus the sum of digits of n in base 2 isn't working at all though... For example... f(2) = 1. Sum of floors is (indeed) 1. digits is 2 right (binary: 10).  But 2 - 2 = 0, not 1.
2018-03-05 16:46:35	Vince_	I guess I can find that out with the direction and speed
2018-03-05 16:46:47	koro	Vince_: but the direction and speed *is* what you want to find?
2018-03-05 16:47:08	koro	Vince_: you have to state what are the *given* things and what you want to find
2018-03-05 16:47:11	ringstuff	2 = 10b, 1 + 0 = 1, Aleric
2018-03-05 16:47:21	probs	Z-module: you get what I said?
2018-03-05 16:47:24	Vince_	well lets say I want to make a visual dot on my game to show where the planet will be when you optimally arive at it :)
2018-03-05 16:47:30	Vince_	(x,Y) on grid
2018-03-05 16:47:31	Aleric	Ohhh, that sum of digits.
2018-03-05 16:47:46	Vince_	and thanks for helping me Koro!
2018-03-05 16:47:47	koro	Vince_: that's the easy part. The hard part is finding the optimal speed and direction
2018-03-05 16:47:50	Z-module	probs, see what I said about a prime dividing a product
2018-03-05 16:47:53	probs	Can you identify anything relevant to proving that in the image I posted?
2018-03-05 16:47:53	Aleric	Yep, that works too :*)
2018-03-05 16:47:56	probs	ok
2018-03-05 16:48:21	Vince_	well i can just lerp the location of ship to optimal planet location over time
2018-03-05 16:48:26	Vince_	no?
2018-03-05 16:48:26	koro	Vince_: so i assume the ship has a maximum speed, but you can choose to travel slower?
2018-03-05 16:48:41	Vince_	its just a fixed speed
2018-03-05 16:48:49	Vince_	ohh i see what your saying
2018-03-05 16:48:54	koro	oh then there aren't many options
2018-03-05 16:49:34	Vince_	its a video game, so we can decide :)
2018-03-05 16:49:45	Vince_	you're a game developper now
2018-03-05 16:50:14	koro	(ಠ_ಠ)
2018-03-05 16:50:20	Vince_	LOL
2018-03-05 16:50:21	probs	to say x 'divides' y is equivalent to saying that y/x = an integer with no remainder, right?
2018-03-05 16:50:45	Vince_	is it easier with 1 max speed or also being able to slow down?
2018-03-05 16:51:06	probs	so 11 divides 66 because 66/11 = 6 with no remainder
2018-03-05 16:51:14	koro	it depends on how serious you want this to be. Are you assumiong the ship is really far from the planet? (in comparison with the radius of the orbit)
2018-03-05 16:51:22	koro	or close
2018-03-05 16:51:46	Vince_	pretty far!
2018-03-05 16:51:54	Vince_	its a whole solar system
2018-03-05 16:52:03	Vince_	like a fast ship but not like light speed
2018-03-05 16:52:16	Batzy	I got asked a hard question I think
2018-03-05 16:52:37	Batzy	lim_(x,y) to (1,2) of [ln(xy^2 - 3)]/[xy^2 - 4]
2018-03-05 16:52:40	Vince_	like simpler formula for me the better since Math isnt my strong suit haha
2018-03-05 16:52:45	Batzy	wolfram says it's 1 but this guy said that wolfram is wrong
2018-03-05 16:52:50	Batzy	i doubt wolfram is wrong.
2018-03-05 16:54:29	probs	[16:45] <Z-module> If you know that a prime p divides ab iff it either divides a or divides b, then you can do it by contradicition. Say n^2 is even. So the prime 2 divides n*n.  So.....
2018-03-05 16:54:38	probs	by contradiction you mean by modus tollens?
2018-03-05 16:54:44	Vince_	koro are you thinking :)
2018-03-05 16:55:22	Batzy	lol
2018-03-05 16:55:27	Batzy	who says "modus tollens"
2018-03-05 16:55:34	Batzy	unless they're trying to sound pompous
2018-03-05 16:55:45	probs	or they're at a university
2018-03-05 16:55:47	Batzy	no but seriously does anyone know this limit problem.
2018-03-05 16:55:59	Batzy	probs: math papers dont even say modus tollens
2018-03-05 16:56:11	probs	it's how discrete math/logic is taught
2018-03-05 16:56:18	koro	Vince_: is it really necessary to travel in a straight line?
2018-03-05 16:56:20	Batzy	yes it's the technical word for it
2018-03-05 16:56:25	probs	great
2018-03-05 16:56:30	Vince_	I think it's easier?
2018-03-05 16:56:36	Vince_	makes more sense no?
2018-03-05 16:56:39	koro	Vince_: you could keep pointing at the planet and change the direction as you go
2018-03-05 16:56:46	probs	and because I'm asking a question about a discrete math problem it should be appropriate to say that
2018-03-05 16:56:51	koro	that way going at a constant speed you'll always reach it
2018-03-05 16:57:05	Vince_	yeah i thought about that
2018-03-05 16:57:14	Vince_	but I cant precalculate when i'd reach it?
2018-03-05 16:57:30	koro	oh, you want to be able to tell that
2018-03-05 16:57:35	Vince_	yeah
2018-03-05 16:57:47	koro	well you can in theory do this by running a simulation :P
2018-03-05 16:57:51	Vince_	i wish i could put a picture
2018-03-05 16:57:56	koro	i mean, it's a quick computation
2018-03-05 16:58:04	drdo	koro: But you won't reach it in the shortest time
2018-03-05 16:58:10	koro	no of course
2018-03-05 16:58:21	Vince_	:O
2018-03-05 16:58:38	Batzy	probs: just say contradiction yo
2018-03-05 16:58:39	drdo	In fact if your ship is slower than the planet you'll never reach it (left as an exercise for the reader)
2018-03-05 16:58:40	koro	but since it's starting from very far from the planet, the difference won't be significative
2018-03-05 16:58:47	Batzy	I've only heard "modus ______" like twice in this channel
2018-03-05 16:58:53	koro	drdo: good point :/
2018-03-05 16:58:57	ringstuff	probs: you can write the argument as modus tollens or by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum)
2018-03-05 16:59:02	koro	drdo: depending on the initial conditions
2018-03-05 16:59:08	Vince_	I cant post pictures here can I
2018-03-05 16:59:16	probs	thank you, I was trying to relate it to something I know, which is modus tollens
2018-03-05 16:59:16	Batzy	So does anyone have any idea how to do this limit?
2018-03-05 16:59:26	Vince_	well I can make my spaceship faster LOL
2018-03-05 16:59:29	ringstuff	Z-module wrote: suppose n were even but n^2 were odd; then n*n is odd, so by Euclid's lemma n is simultaneously even and odd, contradiction
2018-03-05 16:59:50	Vince_	even if the planet was fast, i feel like it should be able to intersect it on it's orbit at one point
2018-03-05 16:59:51	drdo	Vince_: Then just make it so fast that the planet's speed is aproximately zero!
2018-03-05 17:00:02	drdo	and go straight toward it
2018-03-05 17:00:05	Vince_	haha thats not fun though
2018-03-05 17:00:22	probs	How though does supposing n is even relate to my problem though?
2018-03-05 17:00:27	Vince_	i want to tweak the speed so I can get about a month of travel time
2018-03-05 17:00:34	koro	Vince_: of course you can intersect it
2018-03-05 17:00:39	probs	I was told to prove "for all integers n, if n is odd then n^2 is odd'
2018-03-05 17:00:51	koro	what he was saying is that if you keep "following" the planet as i suggested it may happen that you never reach it
2018-03-05 17:01:01	Batzy	again it's lim_(x,y) to (1,2) ln(xy^2 - 3)/(xy^2 - 4)
2018-03-05 17:01:06	probs	why should I even consider even integers?
2018-03-05 17:01:17	Vince_	i see
2018-03-05 17:01:18	koro	i.e, it's a bad idea
2018-03-05 17:01:21	drdo	probs: What's an odd integer?
2018-03-05 17:01:43	probs	an integer that can be defined as 2k+1 where k is an integer
2018-03-05 17:01:51	Vince_	https://i.imgur.com/SXGQYDf.png
2018-03-05 17:01:51	probs	but I'm not allowed to use that definition
2018-03-05 17:01:55	drdo	probs: yes, but what's a more elementary definition?
2018-03-05 17:01:56	Vince_	Here you can see the visual
2018-03-05 17:01:56	ringstuff	probs: are you familiar with reductio ad absurdum?
2018-03-05 17:02:17	probs	yes ringstuff
2018-03-05 17:02:36	Z-module	probs, so what I meant was: you want "n odd ==> n^2 odd".  odd means not even.  So I should have really said "prove the contrapositive:  assume n^2 even, show n is even.  You can do it using that thing I said about a prime that divides a product of two integers.
2018-03-05 17:02:41	probs	drdo: do you mean 'an integer which isn't even" ?
2018-03-05 17:02:53	drdo	probs: yes
2018-03-05 17:03:09	Z-module	which itself comes from the uniqueness of prime factorization for positive integers
2018-03-05 17:03:12	Z-module	(up to order)
2018-03-05 17:04:44	Vince_	so this is pretty difficult then ... hmm
2018-03-05 17:05:03	probs	oh so, I could just think of it as p -> q as "if n is even, n^2 is even" and I'd just have to prove ~p -> ~q in the same way.
2018-03-05 17:06:08	probs	that's proving the inverse though
2018-03-05 17:06:23	ringstuff	Vince_: it's not hard to solve this problem numerically
2018-03-05 17:06:32	probs	You wanted the contrapositive, which is ~q -> ~p. Trying to think about it that way
2018-03-05 17:06:43	Z-module	In ordinary math and logic, proving  p -> q  is exactly the same as proving ~q -> ~p.
2018-03-05 17:06:49	probs	right
2018-03-05 17:06:51	koro	heahm i don't think you want to solve it explicitly
2018-03-05 17:06:55	Vince_	oh?
2018-03-05 17:06:59	gustavn64	What exactly does this mean? I mean, since we can't be sure the sum is absolutely convergent, this means the order matters. Doesn't it?
2018-03-05 17:07:00	gustavn64	https://i.imgur.com/XprlLM0.png
2018-03-05 17:07:05	koro	i mean it's harder than it's worth
2018-03-05 17:07:17	Ozera	https://i.imgur.com/rKUBRAf.jpg In the 'A lower bound' section, why is their conclusion true? That "we cannot hope to spread all the gossip around in fewer than ceil(log_2(n)) days"
2018-03-05 17:07:18	Vince_	lol im not really following
2018-03-05 17:07:30	koro	you want a precise formula
2018-03-05 17:07:32	drdo	You can prove it by more elementary means, or using the cannon of unique factorisation
2018-03-05 17:07:42	koro	that's not so easy for this type of question
2018-03-05 17:07:48	koro	in fact sometimes it's impossible
2018-03-05 17:08:36	Vince_	cannon of unique factorisation... wow LOL okay ill look that up
2018-03-05 17:08:53	koro	that wasn't mean for you i don't think
2018-03-05 17:08:53	Aleric	ringstuff: Ok, I got that part working... can you give me a hint on how to do the inverse of: g(n) = 2 * n - bit_count(n) + 1, where bit_count is the sum of digits in base 2?  This is not what we talked about (that was n - bit_count(n)), but it's the sequence that I really need.
2018-03-05 17:09:07	Vince_	thank god
2018-03-05 17:10:16	Vince_	my buddy said he thinks I could use quadratic equation to solve it?
2018-03-05 17:10:24	koro	nope
2018-03-05 17:10:30	probs	I'm still having trouble with the last part about proving that an even n means n^2 = even
2018-03-05 17:10:31	Z-module	unyu: you asked what the topology of Q/Z is. Lots of intperpretations are possible, but one is simply its realization as the very specific subgroup  {(e^(i*2*pi*q) : q in Q}  of C^*, which as a subspace of euclidean C is just a countable dense subset of the circle. It's =~ Q, by the therem I cited earlier. (I could even give you an explicit homeomorphism if you like.)
2018-03-05 17:10:48	probs	with the 'divides' and 'prime' stuff.
2018-03-05 17:11:14	koro	Vince_: you can use that to find whre you will meet the orbit given that you travel at a given direction, but that doesn't really tell you which direction to travel to meet the actual planet
2018-03-05 17:11:14	ringstuff	probs: pick any particular definition of "n is even"
2018-03-05 17:12:09	koro	it's much trickier to do this, even numerically you have to be careful
2018-03-05 17:12:10	Vince_	oh i c koro
2018-03-05 17:12:14	Aleric	If p and q are integers and p is even then pq is also even.... Isn't that like a given?
2018-03-05 17:12:25	Vince_	can we cheat a bit and simplify it?
2018-03-05 17:12:27	Vince_	since it's a game
2018-03-05 17:12:39	probs	I can't really find one. Usually I just use 2k where k is an integer
2018-03-05 17:12:43	koro	i'd try to help if i didn't have to go now
2018-03-05 17:12:56	Aleric	probs: that would work.
2018-03-05 17:13:00	ringstuff	Aleric: I mean, you can compute the inverse in as many steps as you have bits
2018-03-05 17:13:00	Vince_	damn... thanks for the try though!
2018-03-05 17:13:05	koro	good luck
2018-03-05 17:13:10	probs	I'm not allowed to use that definition, however
2018-03-05 17:13:12	Vince_	thx
2018-03-05 17:13:15	ringstuff	is that not good enough?
2018-03-05 17:13:20	Aleric	n=2k --> n^2 = 2(2k^2)
2018-03-05 17:13:40	ringstuff	probs: again, *pick a definition* and the answer is trivial
2018-03-05 17:13:55	Batzy	ill ask later then I guess.
2018-03-05 17:14:29	Aleric	ringstuff: I don't really have a clue yet no :(.
2018-03-05 17:14:39	probs	the only definition I know is that 2k = n one and I'm not allowed to use it so I can't pick another definition
2018-03-05 17:15:03	probs	something about prime numbers was mentioned?
2018-03-05 17:16:06	⚡	BenLand100 is now known as TheDoctor
2018-03-05 17:16:10	⚡	TheDoctor is now known as Treebeard

2018-03-05 17:16:25	⚡	Freud is now known as BenLand100
2018-03-05 17:17:09	Aleric	probs: How about "even means has at least one prime factor 2"... So, if n does not have any prime factors of 2, then n^2 won't either. But if n does, then so does n^2.  (this is exactly the same as writing n=2k though)
2018-03-05 17:17:57	ringstuff	probs: so your question is "how am I supposed to define an even number?"
2018-03-05 17:18:18	gustavn64	In general, what does it mean to sum from minus infinity to infinity?
2018-03-05 17:18:40	gustavn64	I can't find any single formal definition of it
2018-03-05 17:19:38	unyu	Split your series into two, one where the index goes from -1 to -oo, another where the index goes from 0 to oo.
2018-03-05 17:20:22	unyu	Of course, the choice of “splitting point” is irrelevant.
2018-03-05 17:20:44	gustavn64	That's the formal definition of it? Any reference for that (out of curiousity)?
2018-03-05 17:20:49	ringstuff	gustavn64: alternatively, the sum \Sum_{x \in C} f(x) is the supremum of all finite sums over finite subsets of C
2018-03-05 17:20:50	gustavn64	I couldn't find it
2018-03-05 17:21:13	gustavn64	ringstuff: That's just for non-negative f
2018-03-05 17:21:18	probs	hmm. so I can just say that it's true that if n is even, n^2 is also even because a requirement for n to be even is that it has at least one prime factor of 2
2018-03-05 17:22:05	ringstuff	gustavn64: well, it's the definition whenever the sum converges
2018-03-05 17:22:33	unyu	ringstuff: What if the series is not absolutely convergent on either side?
2018-03-05 17:22:38	probs	ringstuff: my question is maybe answered along the lines of what Aleric said. I need to prove that when n is even, n^2 is also even
2018-03-05 17:22:51	brett01479	ringstuff, it isn't the definition for the same reason that gustavn64 said
2018-03-05 17:22:56	unyu	ringstuff: Also, supremum, really?
2018-03-05 17:23:20	brett01479	ringstuff, if you extend to negatives the natural way, it becomes equivalent to being in L1, which is akin to requiring absolute convergence
2018-03-05 17:24:01	ringstuff	ah
2018-03-05 17:24:06	Batzy	Does anyone know how to find lim_(x,y) to (1,2) ln(xy^2 - 3)/(xy^2 - 4)?

2018-03-05 18:30:56	Batzy	okay so
2018-03-05 18:30:59	Batzy	make a line
2018-03-05 18:31:02	Vince_	but it's velocity(direction) could change...
2018-03-05 18:31:06	Batzy	wtf
2018-03-05 18:31:19	▷	Batzy is done.
2018-03-05 18:31:22	Vince_	lmao
2018-03-05 18:31:23	jimbzy	Hehehe
2018-03-05 18:31:34	Batzy	you said constant velocity
2018-03-05 18:31:43	Vince_	as in no acceleration
2018-03-05 18:31:51	PlanckWalk	Batzy: COnstant velocity of known magnitude but unknown direction
2018-03-05 18:31:51	Batzy	yes so
2018-03-05 18:31:54	Batzy	constant velocity
2018-03-05 18:32:00	Batzy	PlanckWalk: i see now.
2018-03-05 18:32:09	Vince_	but in a game velocity is speed + direciton
2018-03-05 18:32:32	Vince_	yeah exactly planckwalk
2018-03-05 18:32:44	Batzy	that's real life.
2018-03-05 18:32:47	Batzy	lol
2018-03-05 18:32:53	PlanckWalk	(afk)
2018-03-05 18:32:54	Vince_	video games are real life
2018-03-05 18:33:08	Batzy	and idk what it means by "velocity direction could change"
2018-03-05 18:33:10	Batzy	so i am done.
2018-03-05 18:33:23	Batzy	idk why you would need to calculate this in a game anyways
2018-03-05 18:33:32	Batzy	oh
2018-03-05 18:33:34	Vince_	did u see the image?
2018-03-05 18:33:34	Batzy	no i do
2018-03-05 18:33:38	Batzy	yes i did.
2018-03-05 18:33:41	Vince_	i think im confusing u by saying it could change
2018-03-05 18:33:43	Vince_	sorry
2018-03-05 18:33:46	Batzy	no i know now
2018-03-05 18:33:48	Batzy	it doesn't change
2018-03-05 18:34:07	Batzy	you're trying to have the spaceship say "COLLISION IN ____" for a certain velocity
2018-03-05 18:34:08	Vince_	no it doesnt! sorry, if he knows the planet will be there in 30 days. he will go at a constant vector
2018-03-05 18:34:19	Vince_	yes!
2018-03-05 18:34:22	unyu	Let R be a topological ring. Do the constructions of R[x] and R[[x]] come with an induced topology? I expect this to be the case. Moreover, if R is discrete, I expect R[x] to be discrete, but not R[[x]], since a series really has to be the limit of its sequence of partial sums.
2018-03-05 18:34:55	Batzy	yeah
2018-03-05 18:35:05	Batzy	so write the equation for the path of the ship
2018-03-05 18:35:37	Batzy	that's easier than the path of the planet :^)
2018-03-05 18:35:45	Vince_	loll wuttt
2018-03-05 18:35:52	Batzy	mainly because i cant do the path of the planet in my head right now.
2018-03-05 18:36:10	Batzy	so if your velocity is (1,1)
2018-03-05 18:36:15	Batzy	your slope is 1/1
2018-03-05 18:36:20	Vince_	yes
2018-03-05 18:36:39	Batzy	so every "t" increment you have x = t and y = t
2018-03-05 18:36:52	Vince_	yeah
2018-03-05 18:36:58	Batzy	say you have initial position x0, y0
2018-03-05 18:37:09	Batzy	then (x,y) = t(1,1) + (x0,y0)
2018-03-05 18:37:42	Batzy	more compactly that (x,y) = (x0 + t, y0 + t)
2018-03-05 18:38:05	Vince_	yeah that makse sense
2018-03-05 18:38:07	Batzy	good
2018-03-05 18:38:14	Batzy	now draw a picture for figuring it out on a sphere

2018-03-05 18:38:28	Batzy	sorry
2018-03-05 18:38:37	Batzy	Vince_: it's the same idea you just need to know some trig
2018-03-05 18:38:40	Vince_	k im off for supper thx for the help!

2018-03-05 18:42:17	Millennial	unyu: they do
2018-03-05 18:42:28	Millennial	namely, the x-adic topology
2018-03-05 18:42:39	Millennial	R[[x]] is the completion of R[x] in the x-adic topology
2018-03-05 18:43:21	jamesson	 Does this look sane? i.imgur.com/Y55U5bu.png
2018-03-05 18:46:19	somiaj	jamesson: sin(theta) = 1/2 has two solutions on the unit circle, and you only included one.
2018-03-05 18:46:42	somiaj	I really don't know what your goal is, so I can't really say much more than that, unsure what A_t is or what area you are trying to compute.
2018-03-05 18:48:19	jamesson	somiaj: goal is to find area common to r=4 sin (2theta) and r=2
2018-03-05 18:48:42	unyu	Millennial: And what is the topology of R[x]?
2018-03-05 18:49:21	unyu	Millennial: If R[[x]] is really a completion, then R[x] can't be discrete, even for R discrete, as I originally expected, right?
2018-03-05 18:49:33	Millennial	unyu: R[x] is not discrete, no
2018-03-05 18:50:04	Aleric	I'm trying to find the inverse of my function...
2018-03-05 18:50:09	Aleric	still*
2018-03-05 18:50:16	somiaj	jamesson: yea, then I think you need the solution you lost to sin(foo) = 1/2, and I assume you mean you want the area of the four pieces of the pedals that are inside the r=2 circle? https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ukbbc8ssyy
2018-03-05 18:50:43	Batzy	Aleric: whatever function that is
2018-03-05 18:50:48	Millennial	unyu: if you want to "visualize" it, imagine the construction of the cantor set

2018-03-05 20:08:18	wikiemol	This is really simple physics, but for some reason I am just not understanding it. Lets say we have a block of mass m and a force F acting on the block right? So the entire block starts accelerating at an acceleration a. Half of the block has the same acceleration, but it has half the mass. Since F = ma, wouldn't the force on half the block be F/2 ?
2018-03-05 20:17:07	somiaj	wikiemol: seems reasonable, adnt here is ##physics too.

2018-03-05 20:19:56	somiaj	wikiemol: but anyways, I think it is more how you word your question. I don't think you want to think about if you have a full force acting on a block, then you would ahve half the force acting on half the block. Usually you treat the block as a point object at its center of mass
2018-03-05 20:21:41	wikiemol	Maybe you're right
2018-03-05 20:21:46	wikiemol	Thanks
2018-03-05 20:23:00	somiaj	so if you phrased your question as if you had a second block of half the mass of the first, then the force required to move that block with the same acceleratio as the first is half the force.
2018-03-05 20:23:51	somiaj	I think the phsyical issue is you have a single block that is considered a 'rigid' object in physics, you cannot apply a force to just half of it, and you cannot accelerate just half of it without accelerating the other half, but ##physics would be be the place for this, as in you do want a physical explination of thins, not a math one.

Conceptually, I think this is the quantity that we get by splitting n-dimensional space (where w has length n) into little boxes, evaluating p(w) at a point in the box, computing the volume of the box (where vol
2018-03-05 20:34:50	somiaj	think of w being a 2D vector, then dw is an area, and that is like a double integral of f(x,y) dA
2018-03-05 20:35:00	Millennial	waterdrop: if you're integrating over all possible values of w, i.e if \int p(w) dw = 1, then \int p(A|w) p(w) dw = p(A)
2018-03-05 20:35:12	Millennial	p(A|w) p(w) is just p(A \cap w)
2018-03-05 20:35:13	somiaj	so in general it looks like dw is a scalar quanity that represents the 'volume' of a tiny piece of your space.
2018-03-05 20:35:20	Millennial	i.e it's the probability of both happening at the same time

2018-03-05 20:36:58	waterdrop	somiaj: Yeah, I said above that I think that the dw represents volume. I'm not sure what you meant by thinking of w as a 2d vector…does what I said above seem right?

2018-03-05 20:42:05	waterdrop	somiaj: I think this is the quantity that we get by splitting n-dimensional space (where w has length n) into little boxes, evaluating p(w) at a point in the box, computing the volume of the box (where volume is defined in R^n as the product of the lengths of each of the "sides" of the box), using that volume for "dw", and then multiplying p(A|w)p(w)dw, where the w in p(A|w) and p(w) uses the value for w at the center of the box.

2018-03-05 20:46:51	somiaj	I'm trying to parse it, but over all I think that it is more just a generic description of an integral there over including much probability.
2018-03-05 20:47:14	somiaj	but yes, if you wanted to define that integral, that is how you define it interms of volumes of boxes, and taking the limit as the volume of the tiny boxxes ->0

2018-03-05 20:49:21	Guest86004	given a mean of 7.6 and a standard deviation of 3.1, within how many standard deviations of the mean to the values 10, 9, 11, 5, and 3 fall? My choices are 0, 1, 2, and 3
2018-03-05 20:50:10	somiaj	waterdrop: but in this case I would notice that p(w)dw has more meaning than just volume, it is related to the probability measure, or more specifically you can define P(A) = int_A p(w) dw, where p(w) is the density function.
2018-03-05 20:50:11	waterdrop	somiaj: Okay. And the way we compute volume for the "dw" at the end would just be the product of the lengths of the sides, right? So if we wanted to integrate a function f(x_1, …, x_5) in R^5 over a region, we'd split that region into boxes in the usual way, and for each box we'd evaluate f at the center of the box and take the volume to be the product of the length of the sides of the box? (so, 5 sides)
2018-03-05 20:51:12	somiaj	Guest86004: does this help. If you are 2 standard devitions away from the mean you are between 7.6 - 2*3.1 and 7.6 + 2*3.1
2018-03-05 20:51:40	waterdrop	somiaj: Uh, P(A) would be int over w of p(A|w)p(w)dw (that's just the law of total probability). And yeah, p(w)dw is roughly the probability that w falls in the box centered at that specific value of w
2018-03-05 20:52:18	somiaj	waterdrop: so if you only integrate over the set A, then P(A) = int_A p(w) dw, in essence that is how probability is related to a probablity density.
2018-03-05 20:52:58	somiaj	waterdrop: and yes, you can define Riemann integrals in R^n in such a way (though my experience is probablity usually prefers lebesgue integrals)
2018-03-05 20:53:05	somiaj	my very limted experience
2018-03-05 20:53:23	waterdrop	somiaj: Oh sure, if A is a subset of the values that w can take on, then yeah. In the original thing, A was just an event.
2018-03-05 20:53:49	waterdrop	somiaj: But yeah, I see what you're saying. If A is a subset of values that w can take on, then P(w falls in A) = int_Ap(w)dw
2018-03-05 20:54:06	somiaj	waterdrop: and events are subsets of the state space, and the idea is with a probablity measure you can integrate over the event to get its probablity.
2018-03-05 20:54:14	Guest86004	No because Im not sure how to get my answer from that. I put both those into the calculator and didnt get an answer
2018-03-05 20:54:22	waterdrop	somiaj: Ah I see. Okay that's past me :)
2018-03-05 20:55:04	waterdrop	somiaj: thanks for the help
2018-03-05 20:55:06	somiaj	waterdrop: it is basically what you are doing, the major difference I see is what you are doing only works for continous distributions that have a density function p(w).
2018-03-05 20:55:42	waterdrop	somiaj: Right. Yeah, I'm only dealing with such distributions right now :) I unfortunately don't know any measure theory.
2018-03-05 20:55:47	somiaj	waterdrop: if you abstract integration a bit, you can turn put both discrete and continous distributions under the same theory of integration with repsect to a probablity measure.
2018-03-05 20:56:00	waterdrop	I see
2018-03-05 20:56:55	somiaj	Guest86004: Draw out a number line, put the center at 7.6. Go one standard devation to the left and right of that, 7.6 - 3.1 and 7.6 + 3.1, draw a mark, go two standard devitionas away, 7.6 - 2*3.1 and 7.6 + 2*3.1, this way you are measuring distance away in terms of these new ticks, which is number of standard deviations away from the mean
2018-03-05 20:57:17	Guest86004	I got it wrong and it caused me to fail the quiz. Thanks anyway guys.
2018-03-05 20:58:14	somiaj	Guest86004: then put your numbers 10, and so on on the number line, using this new tick system, where do they appear, how far away from the mean are they in terms of standard devations. For example 10: 7.6 + 3.1 = 10.7, so 10 is within 1 standard deviation from the mean, while 12 is between 1 and 2 standard devations from the mean (or within 2 standard devations from the mean)

2018-03-05 21:11:07	i_c-Y	you need AB and BA to be both defined, obviously. but you can do this directly from trace as sum of diagonal entries in one line.
2018-03-05 21:11:59	i_c-Y	tr(AB) = sum(i=1 to n, j=1 to m A(i,j) B(j,i) ) = sum(j=1 to m, i=1 to n B(j,i) A(i,j)) = tr(BA)
2018-03-05 21:12:49	B132	Can you say that the trace(AB) = trace(L_AB) = trace(L_A*L_B) = trace(L_A)trace(L_B) = trace(L_B)trace(L_A) = trace(L_B*L_A) = trace(L_BA) = trace(BA)?
2018-03-05 21:13:58	B132	I think not.
2018-03-05 21:14:00	i_c-Y	no.
2018-03-05 21:14:02	B132	I see what your saying.

I think that makes sense. p(w)dw is the probability of w falling in a small box, and P(A|w) is roughly the probability of A given that w is in that small box. so int_{w}P(A|w)p(w)dw should be P(A) using the law of total probability
2018-03-05 21:33:45	waterdrop	is that right?
2018-03-05 21:35:19	⚡	Phoque is now known as bitch
2018-03-05 21:36:53	somiaj	waterdrop: I think there is some mixing of notation I'm not use to, to me you can only have conditional probabiltiy given an event, and w isn't reprsenting an event here.
2018-03-05 21:37:35	somiaj	but I think there is something I'm over looking
2018-03-05 21:38:07	waterdrop	somiaj: well it's P(A|w={x_1, x_2, …, x_n})…so the probability of A given a specific value for w
2018-03-05 21:38:10	waterdrop	does that make sense?
2018-03-05 21:38:13	somiaj	but anyways, maybe someone else who knows more about this than I can that could help
2018-03-05 21:38:36	waterdrop	btw this is from Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Equation 1.68
2018-03-05 21:40:39	waterdrop	somiaj: https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter5/5_2_3_conditioning_independence.php - what I'm saying above is just the equation 5.16 here
2018-03-05 21:42:28	somiaj	waterdrop: that is more the notation I'm use to, everything there makes sense.
2018-03-05 21:42:47	waterdrop	somiaj: uh, how is it different from what I wrote above?
2018-03-05 21:43:15	waterdrop	P(A) = int_{W}P(A|W=w)p_W(w)dw - does that help?
2018-03-05 21:44:18	waterdrop	int_{W} is over all possible values that W can take on, P(A|W=w) is the probability of the event A given W=w, p_W(w) is the density for W
2018-03-05 21:47:09	somiaj	waterdrop: for me since I'm not familar with the theory, small things just confuse me, P(A|w) didn't make sense because I didn't realize there was a random variable W involved.
2018-03-05 21:47:44	waterdrop	somiaj: Okay but it does make sense now right?
2018-03-05 21:48:06	somiaj	anyways seems reasonable, I don't know enough to say for sure though.
2018-03-05 21:48:13	waterdrop	ok
2018-03-05 21:49:00	waterdrop	somiaj: well for equation 5.16 on the page I linked, the P(A|X=x) would just be the probability for A given a value x for X, right? It would not be a density.

2018-03-05 21:57:04	webbb	hi
2018-03-05 21:57:20	webbb	hm, so when I multiply two sine functions I can somehow simplify them?
2018-03-05 21:57:30	webbb	sin(22deg) * sin(10deg) ? :)
2018-03-05 21:57:37	webbb	or is there no way making it simpler?
2018-03-05 21:58:29	somiaj	df00z: don't quite follow what you are asking, what 1 are you taking about? something like a^0 = 1?
2018-03-05 21:59:04	somiaj	webbb: define simpiler? What is your goal? (like are you trying to find an antiderivative)
2018-03-05 21:59:34	webbb	somiaj: could I avoid further calculating the actual sinus value?
2018-03-05 21:59:45	df00z	He's using a compound interest formula to explain euler's formula.  A = P(1 + r / n) ^ n    Where A is amount, P is principal, r is interest rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year
2018-03-05 22:00:11	df00z	where is the "1" coming from in this formula?
2018-03-05 22:00:54	waterdrop	somiaj: Uh, now I think more about it though, how does that make sense rigorously? x is continuous, so X=x formally has 0 probability, right? so P(A|X=x) should be 0?
2018-03-05 22:00:56	somiaj	webbb: with those angles I don't think you can get any nice calculation you can use special angles. So if you want a result, just plug it into a calculator.
2018-03-05 22:01:06	df00z	I see it more like      (r/n) + (r/n) + (r/n) if n is 3
2018-03-05 22:01:07	somiaj	webbb: there is what is known as the product to sum formulas that might help.
2018-03-05 22:01:22	df00z	How do i intuit the "1" in the formula
2018-03-05 22:01:37	somiaj	df00z: the interst formula gives the amount, so the 1 is what you start with.
2018-03-05 22:02:11	df00z	It's not what you start with though
2018-03-05 22:02:12	df00z	thats P
2018-03-05 22:02:17	df00z	the second one
2018-03-05 22:02:22	somiaj	df00z: Example, simple interst 5%, and the amount is $100. The interst is $100*0.05 = $5, the new amount is $100 + 0.05*$100 = $100*(1 + 0.05)
2018-03-05 22:02:42	df00z	Yes!
2018-03-05 22:02:43	somiaj	df00z: it is 100% = 1 is what you start with.
2018-03-05 22:02:45	df00z	that last piece there
2018-03-05 22:02:46	webbb	somiaj: yes, exactly this! :)
2018-03-05 22:03:23	somiaj	df00z: In general if you increase by 5%, then you are 105% of the starting amount.
2018-03-05 22:03:46	somiaj	df00z: so if you increase by an interst rate of r, the amount you multiply by is 1+r
2018-03-05 22:04:04	df00z	Hmmm.

2018-03-05 22:05:41	somiaj	Unsure what is the best key words for google. look up things like "percentage increase" and "percentage of", these are different, yet related ideas.
2018-03-05 22:06:01	somiaj	illustion: what does conformally equivlant mean?
2018-03-05 22:06:14	illustion	meaning biholomorphism
2018-03-05 22:06:50	illustion	holomorphic map that is bijective
2018-03-05 22:08:07	waterdrop	somiaj: Any idea about my last question?
2018-03-05 22:09:05	illustion	I think it would contradict Riemann mapping theorem ?
2018-03-05 22:09:35	somiaj	illustion: D is not simply connected
2018-03-05 22:09:42	illustion	yes
2018-03-05 22:09:52	illustion	D1 and D2 aren’t simply connected
2018-03-05 22:10:02	somiaj	illustion: but I don't know a simple way to say this, because they seem very similar to me (both discs with holes in them)
2018-03-05 22:10:14	somiaj	illustion: so the Riemann mapping theroem wont' apply
2018-03-05 22:10:31	illustion	yes
2018-03-05 22:12:06	somiaj	waterdrop: I'm unsure there, but I don't see the overall goal. Are you trying to prove some relation, or just looking for a nice way to define P(A) with an integral?
2018-03-05 22:13:03	waterdrop	somiaj: I'm just wondering why it makes sense to say that P(A|X=x) is the probability of A given X=x, when X=x should technically have probability 0 for any x since X is continuous
2018-03-05 22:17:03	df00z	I get it I think - 100 *(1 + .05) is equivalent to 100 + 0.05*100.      I guess when to do that kind of transformation as it relates to using pow isn't intuitive to me.
2018-03-05 22:18:02	somiaj	df00z: you repeate this, start with $100, after one cycle you have $100*(1 + 0.05) = $105, now you start the new cycle with $105, so you do $105*(1 + 0.05) = .. and then you get the result and repeate.
2018-03-05 22:18:06	somiaj	df00z: that make sense?
2018-03-05 22:18:56	df00z	Yeah.
2018-03-05 22:19:14	somiaj	waterdrop: yea I'm not quite sure what is going on, they might be working with a density there and not a probablity, but I only know the very basics of the theory so subtle things like that get me too. Formally it might be something liek this. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability_distribution#Continuous_distributions
2018-03-05 22:19:16	df00z	Thanks, now I can progress.
2018-03-05 22:19:50	Z-module	hmm, illustion, is this the same as proving that for any holomorphic bijecction f:D1 -> D2,  f' has a zero somewhere in D1 ?
2018-03-05 22:19:58	somiaj	df00z: well I'm just gonna not do any computations and whatch what happesn: Start with 100, then get 100*(1 + 0.05), then get [100*(1 + 0.05)] * (1 + 0.05) = 100*(1 + 0.05)^2
2018-03-05 22:20:45	somiaj	df00z: then I'm going to take the next step which is [100*(1 + 0.05)^2] * (1 + 0.05) = 100*(1 + 0.05)^3, and so on.
2018-03-05 22:21:01	illustion	Z-module: so I think I got it
2018-03-05 22:21:07	somiaj	so each step I apply interest I multiply by (1 + 0.05) to the previous ammount, and repeating this turns into exponents.

2018-03-05 22:47:11	somiaj	waterdrop: It is probably some density like thing if you think in terms of Riemann integrals, recall that you really have cubes, so you have P(A| X in small box centered at x) * p(x) * volume of box, making this -> 0 will give that term sense, even if it is equal to 0 in the limit of P(A|X=x), though i'm unsure if this is a good way to intruprit it or not.
2018-03-05 22:58:25	waterdrop	somiaj: Oh I guess it does make sense to think of P(A|X=x) as the limit of P(A|X is in a small box centered at x) as the volume of the box -> 0
2018-03-05 22:59:50	somiaj	yea it is 0, but in the integral it gains meaning
2018-03-05 23:00:00	somiaj	(well provided x isn't a point mass)
2018-03-05 23:00:17	waterdrop	somiaj: well it's not 0 actually
2018-03-05 23:00:50	waterdrop	I think P(A|X=x) is defined to be the limit of P(A|X falls in a box centered at x) as the volume of that box -> 0
2018-03-05 23:00:55	waterdrop	that limit wouldn't be 0
2018-03-05 23:01:03	waterdrop	*wouldn't necessarily be 0
2018-03-05 23:04:19	waterdrop	somiaj: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's right - check this out http://www.stat.yale.edu/~pollard/Courses/241.fall2014/notes2014/CtsCondition.pdf (the 8.5 part, where they define E[Y|X=x] using a limit like I described above)
2018-03-05 23:05:40	waterdrop	X is a continuous random variable there with density function f, and they define, E(Y|X=z) = limit as e -> 0 of E(Y|z <= X <= z + e)
2018-03-05 23:09:03	somiaj	I think they are defining it inside the integral which changes things. But this is not something I know much about.
2018-03-05 23:14:19	waterdrop	somiaj: what do you mean by defining it inside the integral?
2018-03-05 23:15:14	somiaj	the integral itself is a limit as the things you are summing up approach zero, so it is fine for that limit to approach zero and still give the integral a non-zero value.
2018-03-05 23:17:18	waterdrop	somiaj: But P(A|X=x) has a definition independent of the integral (and so does p(w), the density for W). The only thing "going to 0" in the integral is dw, the volume of the box.
2018-03-05 23:18:05	waterdrop	The integral is a limit of a Riemann sum as the volumes of the boxes you use go to 0, right? But P(A|X=x) is defined independently of the limit of the Riemann sum.
2018-03-05 23:18:51	waterdrop	somiaj: what I'm saying is that P(A|X=x) is defined to be the limit as e -> 0 of P(A|x - e < X < x + e), which has nothing to do with the Riemann integral.
2018-03-05 23:20:27	somiaj	Okay, but for a continous random variable, that would give 0, as you pointed out eariler.
2018-03-05 23:20:49	waterdrop	somiaj: no it wouldn't give 0
2018-03-05 23:21:29	waterdrop	somiaj: in the page I linked above with the stat 241 course notes from yale, they define E[Y|X=x] = lim e -> 0 of E[Y|x - e < X < x + e]
2018-03-05 23:21:34	somiaj	why do you think it wouldn't be 0? I can only see it not being zero in the case x is a point mass.
2018-03-05 23:22:36	waterdrop	somiaj: We're taking the limit as e -> 0 on the right hand side, right? For any e > 0, P(A|x - e < X < x + e) is non zero.
2018-03-05 23:22:53	waterdrop	*well, can be non-zero
2018-03-05 23:23:06	waterdrop	P(A| x - 0.001 < X < x + 0.001), for example
2018-03-05 23:23:16	somiaj	sure, but its limit will be 0 if X is continous.
2018-03-05 23:23:29	somiaj	(though maybe I'm not understanding the conditional correclty)
2018-03-05 23:24:05	somiaj	oh I see, yea I was missunderstanding the conditional.
2018-03-05 23:25:16	somiaj	as I said, I'm not that good at this stuff...:/
2018-03-05 23:26:07	waterdrop	somiaj: How were you reading it? yeah intuitively as e -> 0, then x - e < X < x + e is a smaller part of the sample space, but P(A|x - e < X < x + e) is just looking at the fraction that A takes up in that much smaller sample space, so it doesn't necessarily -> 0. the sample space you're looking at is getting smaller as e -> 0, but we care about the percentage of that space that A takes up
2018-03-05 23:27:07	waterdrop	somiaj: np, your feedback helped me clarify a lot of stuff for myself :)
2018-03-05 23:27:09	somiaj	waterdrop: I was thinking more about the fact the probablity of a continous variable -> 0 as e->0, but I forgot about the division by this probablity, i.e. P(A and |x - X| < e)/P( |x - X| < e ) using the definition of conditional probablity.
2018-03-05 23:27:27	somiaj	and since both the numerator and denomaaintor are goint to zero, that can have a non zero probablity
2018-03-05 23:27:40	somiaj	(I was only focusing on the fact the numerator went to zero)
2018-03-05 23:28:10	somiaj	and it is the division by zero why they have to define it as such.
2018-03-05 23:28:14	waterdrop	somiaj: yeah, I think my more intuitive description above about the sample space getting smaller as e -> 0 but us caring about the fraction that A takes up in that smaller sample space was pretty much just saying what you just said
2018-03-05 23:29:15	waterdrop	somiaj: not sure what you mean by the division by 0
2018-03-05 23:29:44	somiaj	waterdrop: A common definition of conditional probablity is P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B)
2018-03-05 23:29:55	waterdrop	yeah I'm familiar with that
2018-03-05 23:30:08	somiaj	here B = |x - X| < e, and that probablity -> 0 as e -> 0 [that is the probablity I was thinking about]
2018-03-05 23:30:43	somiaj	so P(B) -> 0 as e->0
2018-03-05 23:30:49	waterdrop	somiaj: yep. but yeah since we care about the fraction that A takes up, it works fine :)
2018-03-05 23:31:03	somiaj	correct, but that is what I was over looking when I thought the limit would always be 0
2018-03-05 23:31:15	waterdrop	somiaj: right
2018-03-05 23:31:58	waterdrop	I feel like I should probably read a more rigorous probability book before continuing with my current machine learning book…not sure what to read though. I've taken real analysis but it didn't cover lebesgue integration or measure theory.
2018-03-05 23:33:02	somiaj	The measure theory approach is nice because it puts both continous and discrete under the same frame work (which mostly boils down to an infinte sum is just an integral over a discrete measure)
2018-03-05 23:33:30	waterdrop	I see
2018-03-05 23:33:50	waterdrop	maybe I'll just keep learning as I go for now
2018-03-05 23:34:51	Batzy	Are all complete theories decidable?
2018-03-05 23:35:24	Batzy	nevermind.
2018-03-05 23:40:38	Batzy	Also what does the latex command \models really mean?

2018-03-05 23:57:22	Batzy	also one more question
2018-03-05 23:58:14	Batzy	https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/158676/complete-incomplete-theory for the anwer given here, we would say that "all models are isomorphic to C_3"?
2018-03-06 00:02:07	Millennial	Batzy: yeah
2018-03-06 00:05:42	Zebs	What is the proper way to denote a telescoping set before cancelling things out?
2018-03-06 00:05:53	Zebs	Telescoping sum, I should say.
2018-03-06 00:07:23	Zebs	Is it proper to do something like (b - a) + (c - b) + ... + (n - (n - 1))?
2018-03-06 00:08:10	Millennial	Zebs: yes
2018-03-06 00:08:10	Zebs	And will the implication of there being a prior (n - 1) be clear enough when it is crossed out?
2018-03-06 00:08:16	Millennial	yes
2018-03-06 00:08:18	somiaj	something like that is fine, usually just enough terms to make the cancelation obvious.
2018-03-06 00:08:26	Zebs	Awesom, thanks!
2018-03-06 00:08:38	Zebs	*Awesome
2018-03-06 00:09:24	unyu	It doesn't hurt to write \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - x_{i-1}) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i=1}^n x_{i-1} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i = x_n - x_0
2018-03-06 00:13:02	Zebs	Interesting. So a distribution of the sum before rearranging.
2018-03-06 00:21:53	Zebs	So, excuse my poor understanding, the -1 of x-1 can distribute to the upper and lower bounds?
2018-03-06 00:25:43	Millennial	unyu: re your question about R[x]: there's a nice result which says that if K is a field, then the only bounded valuations on K[x] are p-adic for some prime p in K[x]
2018-03-06 00:26:01	Millennial	a valuation is a norm which respects the ring structure, i.e |ab| = |a| |b|
2018-03-06 00:26:23	Millennial	this probably doesn't answer your question
2018-03-06 00:26:25	Millennial	but it's a nice result
2018-03-06 00:26:28	Millennial	so i thought i'd mention it
2018-03-06 00:34:32	unyu	Millennial: Ah, thanks!
2018-03-06 00:35:13	a____ptr	Im not sure how to prove this..
2018-03-06 00:35:35	a____ptr	Say f: A open subset R^n -> R^n
2018-03-06 00:35:55	a____ptr	With f injective and det f'(a) is never zero
2018-03-06 00:36:11	a____ptr	Then f(A) is open and its inverse is diff-able
2018-03-06 00:36:39	a____ptr	{also spivak's doesn't mention f is C^1... But I think you're supposed to assume it too}
2018-03-06 00:37:55	math543	a____ptr is f: R^n -> R^n or A -> R^n?
2018-03-06 00:38:02	a____ptr	I kinda get that for every p in A, we have open nbhds in the domain and codomain which f is homeomorphic
2018-03-06 00:38:09	a____ptr	math543: the latter
2018-03-06 00:39:26	a____ptr	(That's from the inverse mapping theorem), so you have an open cover, but I'm not really sure how this entails f(A) is open
2018-03-06 00:40:04	a____ptr	The union of the open nbhds of f(p) is an open cover which f(A) is a subset of, but idk how to show equality I guess
2018-03-06 00:40:31	pedro3005	of course f(A) is the union of all f(p)'s for p in A
2018-03-06 00:40:56	a____ptr	Yeah, but that doesnt really tell you anything
2018-03-06 00:40:58	pedro3005	so if each f(p) has an open nbhd contained in f(A)
2018-03-06 00:41:09	pedro3005	then f(A) is the union of all these open nbhds
2018-03-06 00:41:14	math543	Can anyone help me with https://imgur.com/a/Q3c7o c, and d. ?
2018-03-06 00:41:39	math543	(functional analysis)
2018-03-06 00:41:44	a____ptr	pedro3005: if gig
2018-03-06 00:41:48	a____ptr	Damnit
2018-03-06 00:42:13	a____ptr	pedro3005: is open nbhd of f(p) supposed to be contained in f(A)?
2018-03-06 00:42:28	pedro3005	well it's the image of an open nbhd of p
2018-03-06 00:42:29	a____ptr	(From the statement of inverse function theorem)
2018-03-06 00:42:35	pedro3005	so how wouldn't it be
2018-03-06 00:42:47	a____ptr	Ah right
2018-03-06 00:42:56	a____ptr	Yeah you're right thanks
2018-03-06 00:43:04	a____ptr	 (I missed that)
2018-03-06 00:43:15	math543	what? why is an open neighborhood of f(p) contained in f(A)
2018-03-06 00:43:35	math543	consider f: [0, 1] -> [0, 1] given by x |-> x
2018-03-06 00:43:43	a____ptr	Its the image of an open nbhd of p math543
2018-03-06 00:44:04	math543	f: [0, 1] -> R xigven by x |-> x.
2018-03-06 00:44:12	a____ptr	(For sufficiently small enough nbhd)
2018-03-06 00:44:12	math543	f(1) = 1.
2018-03-06 00:44:23	math543	1 has no open neighborhood in f([0, 1]). ...
2018-03-06 00:44:25	math543	I'm confused
2018-03-06 00:44:39	math543	either you are wrong or you stated something incorrectly.
2018-03-06 00:44:43	pedro3005	lesson of the day: be careful around manifolds with boundary
2018-03-06 00:45:02	math543	pedro3005 so you agree that I have a counterexample to what you said
2018-03-06 00:45:17	pedro3005	no, i agree that you joined the conversation without understanding its context
2018-03-06 00:45:31	a____ptr	Brb
2018-03-06 00:45:36	thermo	B)
2018-03-06 00:45:38	math543	lol. so please explain to me then why I did not provide a counterexample
2018-03-06 00:46:00	math543	your claim was that p in A implies f(p) has open nhood in f(A)?
2018-03-06 00:46:04	pedro3005	the inverse function theorem as we're talking about it is for functions on an open subset of euclidean space
2018-03-06 00:46:25	pedro3005	that is true if f'(p) is invertible
2018-03-06 00:47:02	pedro3005	and p is in the interior of A
2018-03-06 00:47:12	math543	I agree. sorry as stated I didn't see these conditions
2018-03-06 00:47:38	math543	this prevents countereexamples like the one I had or f: (0, 1) -> R given by x |-> 0.
2018-03-06 00:47:56	math543	(the former because of open domain), the latter because of invertibility of f'
2018-03-06 00:48:00	math543	(i.e., det f' != 0

2018-03-06 00:48:37	addem	Trying to show that the absolute value of the contour integral of (z+4)/(z^3-1) over quarter-circle from 2 to 2i is bounded above by 6pi/7.  Thought about using the ML Theorem by L is already pi, and it seems unlikely that the integrand is at most 6/7 in absolute value.
2018-03-06 00:48:42	torchinz	can't understand, how they got the t-value in here: https://imgur.com/oErH9Nq   . Please help
2018-03-06 00:49:39	addem	torchinz: They used a computer with fancy numerical optimization methods and stuff.
2018-03-06 00:49:48	addem	You'll likely never need to know how to generate those numbers.
2018-03-06 00:50:09	addem	But if you really want to know, it's the integral of a function sorta like the Gaussian distribution.
2018-03-06 00:50:28	math543	Can anyone help me with https://imgur.com/a/Q3c7o c, and d. ?
2018-03-06 00:50:50	torchinz	addem, can I discuss that in a PM?
2018-03-06 00:51:03	addem	torchinz: Actually, I take that back, I was thinking of the significance, not the t.
2018-03-06 00:51:17	antonfire	addem: have you tried checking whether the integrand is at most 6/7
2018-03-06 00:51:20	addem	The t comes from standardizing--you need to know the mean, variance, and degrees of freedom.
2018-03-06 00:52:28	addem	antonfire: I started poking at that, but it didn't seem like it was going to turn out right.  But perhaps I should labor on that route harder.
2018-03-06 00:53:26	antonfire	You could evaluate the integrand at a couple of points on that curve and see what the absolute value is to sanity-check the thing that seems unlikely to you.

2018-03-06 01:03:39	addem	I've seen horseshoe used as implication, but not from right-to-left.
2018-03-06 01:04:01	a____ptr	yeah i would write the other way around but i dont have reflected c on my keyboard
2018-03-06 01:04:14	addem	Ah, yeah, that used to be and still is kind of common notation.
2018-03-06 01:04:36	addem	Among logicians, usually ones with a stronger Philosophy bent.
2018-03-06 01:04:55	a____ptr	ah, addem so its more common in phil-related stuffs?
2018-03-06 01:06:23	addem	Yeah.  Of course I'm sure it bleeds out of there, but Quine's book, Priest, lots of logicians who are philosophers use it to mean "material conditional" as distinct from other sorts of conditionals.
2018-03-06 01:06:43	addem	I think I read a linguistics-heavy logic book that did that too, again distinguishing the material conditional from other conditionals.
2018-03-06 01:07:35	a____ptr	i didnt know about those, thats neat

2018-03-06 01:16:51	addem	What is the contour integral, intuitively?  We can't talk about the area of a curtain in this context.
2018-03-06 01:18:27	marxS	do we always obtain the normal closure by just adjoining the "missing" zeros
2018-03-06 01:18:29	marxS	of a polynomial
2018-03-06 01:18:30	addem	I guess maybe the best way to think about it is as the "net change"?
2018-03-06 01:19:35	dalcde	a____ptr: Russel & Whitehead does that, for example.
2018-03-06 01:22:22	Millennial	marxS: yes
2018-03-06 01:22:32	Millennial	well, not "a polynomial"
2018-03-06 01:22:54	Millennial	but doing it for the elements of a basis for the field extension is enough
2018-03-06 01:25:17	marxS	damn normal closures and k-monomorphisms are confusing af lol
2018-03-06 01:25:37	Millennial	marxS: what's confusing about them
2018-03-06 01:26:09	marxS	idk, just stuff like this: http://i.imgur.com/dgVzAxl.png
2018-03-06 01:26:18	marxS	like there's a few different things to wrap your head around
2018-03-06 01:26:39	marxS	all these monomorphisms linking to automorphisms through isomorphisms of field extensions blah blah...
2018-03-06 01:27:24	Millennial	marxS: i assume they are saying these things have the same image, which they should have said explicitly
2018-03-06 01:27:37	Millennial	because an embedding K -> L is not an automorphism of K
2018-03-06 01:27:56	dalcde	Yeah, a better way of saying (2) and (3) is that every embedding of L/K into a normal extension has the same image.
2018-03-06 01:28:02	Millennial	yes
2018-03-06 01:28:16	dalcde	What you really ought/want to do is to say that every embedding into the Galois/separable closure has the same image
2018-03-06 01:28:23	dalcde	But somehow people have an irrational fear of these closure things
2018-03-06 01:28:32	dalcde	Maybe because they are not finite.
2018-03-06 01:28:34	Millennial	dalcde: why are we taking a separable closure
2018-03-06 01:28:38	Millennial	you mean normal closure
2018-03-06 01:29:14	dalcde	s/Galois/algebraic/, I mean
2018-03-06 01:29:20	Millennial	oh
2018-03-06 01:29:27	Millennial	yeah, sure
2018-03-06 02:25:10	Batzy	Is it fair to define a model as a set which satisfies a set of axioms?
2018-03-06 02:25:54	Batzy	nvm i get it
2018-03-06 02:28:24	pedro3005	get a model theory book and read the definition of model
2018-03-06 02:28:31	Batzy	OK :(
2018-03-06 02:28:34	Batzy	no i got it
2018-03-06 02:28:42	Batzy	pedro3005: Enderton is good?
2018-03-06 02:28:43	Batzy	I hear
2018-03-06 02:28:57	pedro3005	dunno
2018-03-06 02:29:03	Batzy	Do you have one you like?
2018-03-06 02:30:10	pedro3005	i read a bit of one by david marker, iirc, that was okay. at least it got to the interesting stuff rather than beating around the bush with a bunch of boring elementary logic crap
2018-03-06 02:30:39	pedro3005	it skips a lot of foundational stuff about first order logic but really who wants to see that
2018-03-06 02:35:39	blackk	still discussing model theory
2018-03-06 02:36:02	blackk	I know of only one book but I never read it nor I know anything about model theory

2018-03-06 02:36:42	Batzy	nice
2018-03-06 02:36:46	Batzy	I might do the enderton book first
2018-03-06 02:36:56	Batzy	because I would like to learn elementary logic crap
2018-03-06 02:36:56	Batzy	:P
2018-03-06 02:37:15	blackk	is it only mere interest or related to something else
2018-03-06 02:39:32	Batzy	Well
2018-03-06 02:39:36	Batzy	im interested.
2018-03-06 02:39:46	Batzy	which has caused it to be related to something else
2018-03-06 02:44:42	Batzy	So
2018-03-06 02:44:54	Batzy	Two models being isomorphic is really just two sets being isomorphic.
2018-03-06 02:45:45	Batzy	like a model that is N and a model that is Q would be isomorphic.
2018-03-06 02:46:02	Batzy	it's that simple... okay
2018-03-06 02:46:11	blackk	I cant even remember what a model was.. I just read 3 pages of Marker like a decade ago
2018-03-06 02:46:22	blackk	I vaguely remember language, theorem etc.
2018-03-06 02:46:29	Batzy	blackk: so if I had a set of field axioms
2018-03-06 02:46:32	Batzy	a model for that would be Q
2018-03-06 02:46:42	Batzy	it's a "structure" which satisfies those axioms
2018-03-06 02:46:59	blackk	yeah there is a more precise definition of structure if I can recall
2018-03-06 02:47:09	Batzy	let me see if its in this book
2018-03-06 02:47:32	blackk	let me check marker meanwhile
2018-03-06 02:47:55	Batzy	it's a longish definition
2018-03-06 02:47:56	Batzy	lol
2018-03-06 02:48:03	blackk	rifght its in the first page
2018-03-06 02:48:05	blackk	of marker
2018-03-06 02:48:09	blackk	here it isnt too long
2018-03-06 02:48:15	Batzy	and the one i found is a structure of a first order language too
2018-03-06 02:48:16	blackk	first it defines a language
2018-03-06 02:48:22	Batzy	wow
2018-03-06 02:48:31	Batzy	What's that book called again? Do you have it in pdf?
2018-03-06 02:48:32	blackk	which consists of 3 things

2018-03-06 02:48:46	blackk	I saw Marker in a conference once

2018-03-06 02:48:53	blackk	I have it in pdf
2018-03-06 02:48:58	Batzy	can you like give it to me
2018-03-06 02:49:01	blackk	send me your email I send you the goodies
2018-03-06 02:49:01	Batzy	dropbox, email, whatever
2018-03-06 02:49:04	Batzy	kk
2018-03-06 02:49:09	blackk	ok dropbox would work too
2018-03-06 02:49:18	blackk	gimme a minute
2018-03-06 02:49:23	Batzy	I msged you
2018-03-06 02:51:00	blackk	oh its djvu if thats ok with you
2018-03-06 02:52:06	Batzy	That's fine
2018-03-06 02:53:10	Batzy	why do people use djvu anyways?
2018-03-06 02:53:18	blackk	it has higher compression rate
2018-03-06 02:53:32	blackk	for a better quality
2018-03-06 02:53:42	Batzy	Now I know XD
2018-03-06 02:53:49	blackk	but creating djvu is a pain
2018-03-06 02:54:28	blackk	reading it is only difficult if you are using an e-reader that doesnt have built in support (like kindle maybe)
2018-03-06 02:54:45	blackk	anyway
2018-03-06 02:54:49	blackk	a language is a triple
2018-03-06 02:55:01	blackk	a set of functions F
2018-03-06 02:55:12	blackk	and for each elemetn f in F there is an associated integer n_f
2018-03-06 02:55:19	blackk	positive integer rather
2018-03-06 02:55:52	blackk	"functions" are just symbol in this context
2018-03-06 02:56:10	blackk	a set of relation R and similarly for each r in R a positive number n_r is given
2018-03-06 02:56:21	blackk	"relation" again just symbol
2018-03-06 02:56:28	blackk	a set of constant symbols C
2018-03-06 02:57:04	blackk	and marker has example
2018-03-06 02:57:09	blackk	e.g. language of rings
2018-03-06 02:57:29	blackk	consists of {+,-,.} as set of binary function symbols
2018-03-06 02:57:39	blackk	{0,1} as set of constant
2018-03-06 02:58:07	blackk	and empty set as the set of relations
2018-03-06 02:58:24	blackk	+,-,. are 2-ary so we associate 2 to each
2018-03-06 02:58:57	blackk	so if L is a language
2018-03-06 02:59:05	blackk	one can define an L-structure
2018-03-06 02:59:23	blackk	which you can read in marker :P
2018-03-06 02:59:31	blackk	its 5 lines only

2018-03-06 03:00:18	blackk	I think its the beginners recommendation for model theory
2018-03-06 03:00:31	Batzy	I don't think it's an absolute beginners thing
2018-03-06 03:00:44	Batzy	he said it's appropriate for people who have taken 1 UG course in logic and 1 grad course
2018-03-06 03:00:48	blackk	well sure in some examples you need to know some algebra
2018-03-06 03:01:03	Batzy	he said he assumes things like knowledge of Zorn's lemma
2018-03-06 03:01:09	blackk	oh ok
2018-03-06 03:01:22	blackk	thats not too much cause for concern
2018-03-06 03:01:40	blackk	but I never had logic in my life and I could follow the first 2 pages
2018-03-06 03:02:15	Batzy	me neither
2018-03-06 03:02:22	Batzy	I wonder why the language for hereditary sets is empty though

2018-03-06 03:37:20	hamad	I want numerical solution for the values of x
2018-03-06 03:37:32	hamad	of f(x)*
2018-03-06 03:37:57	hamad	I am not sure how to write it in matlab
2018-03-06 03:39:55	lieven	so f(x)+f(1-1/x)=arctan x

2018-03-06 03:42:38	hamad	so can I ?
2018-03-06 03:44:00	hamad	my perception is I need an initial point to solve it?

2018-03-06 11:22:36	math833	damn thats pretty cool
2018-03-06 11:22:56	Galois	so the tool that made this advanced functionality possible is a new proof technique, called "Sequences of Games" (that's the title of the paper)
2018-03-06 11:23:07	unyu	Ah...
2018-03-06 11:23:18	Galois	the subtitle is: A tool for taming complexity in security proofs
2018-03-06 11:23:37	Galois	basically it lets you modularize a security proof into a series of small, manageable transitions
2018-03-06 11:24:19	Galois	now if you actually read any crypto paper since 2004 that does advanced functionality and contains a security proof, then it uses the Sequences of Games technique
2018-03-06 11:24:53	Galois	I mean nowadays they don't even explain the technique anymore, they assume everyone knows it. "We define security of protocol A in terms of the following game: ..."
2018-03-06 11:24:58	Kanov	that is quite a strong generalization, Galois, how certain are you of it's validity
2018-03-06 11:25:02	unyu	That seems like a good analogue of what I'm doing as well: I'm modularizing proofs of correctness of various data structures, and finding out that ostensibly wildly different data structures might have common parts, after all.
2018-03-06 11:25:44	Galois	I agree that if you're designing new proof techniques then you're approaching the problem from the right perspective. Of course success is not guaranteed. It might just be too hard to solve.
2018-03-06 11:26:11	Galois	"can be done by an undergraduate" is a difficult standard to meet. I would say sequences of games can be learned and mastered by a graduate student.
2018-03-06 11:26:27	koro	hey i need a translation of the word "eclatable" to english. "Eclatement" translates to "blow-up", but for some reason "blow-upable" sounds pretty shitty. Is there another word?
2018-03-06 11:26:40	unyu	Galois: Fortunately, I have an easy way to tell whether something can be done by an undergraduate. As I said, *I* am an undergraduate.
2018-03-06 11:26:51	harrynoob	koro: "admits blow-ups"?
2018-03-06 11:27:09	Galois	that doesn't work, since this kind of breakthrough research usually takes years, by which time you won't be an undergraduate anymore
2018-03-06 11:27:09	jhpy1024	Hey guys, anyone here familiar with mixed-integer linear programming? I'm modelling a problem and could use a little help
2018-03-06 11:27:09	koro	that's not an adjective!
2018-03-06 11:27:18	math833	blow-up is used in graph theory
2018-03-06 11:27:23	harrynoob	indeed it is not
2018-03-06 11:27:28	koro	it's used in many places
2018-03-06 11:27:35	math833	expandable?
2018-03-06 11:27:36	koro	but anyway, I would really like an adjective :/
2018-03-06 11:27:47	Galois	burstable, inflatable
2018-03-06 11:27:56	koro	lolwhat, no
2018-03-06 11:28:02	unyu	Galois: Yeah, I've been doing this for years already, indeed. Well before I decided to study math, even.
2018-03-06 11:28:18	harrynoob	koro: are we talking about blow-up of say, varieties, or schemes, or whatever here?
2018-03-06 11:28:22	harrynoob	(eg algebraic geometry)
2018-03-06 11:28:31	harrynoob	(s/eg/ie/)
2018-03-06 11:28:34	koro	similar kind of, but simpler setting (just blow-up of points)
2018-03-06 11:28:47	koro	e.g. replacing a point by a circle, say
2018-03-06 11:29:10	dalcde	unyu: If I end up in academia, thirty years later I will enter an undergraduate degree in English, and tell everyone the research I do can be done by undergraduates.
2018-03-06 11:29:21	jhpy1024	Is it okay to have indicator variables (for conditionals) in an objective function of a MILP?
2018-03-06 11:29:41	harrynoob	you might opt for a different word. in a context i'm working in right now, the blow-up is referred to as the "modification" along a specific map. "modifiable" is nice
2018-03-06 11:29:44	math833	Lol
2018-03-06 11:29:56	harrynoob	other than that, blow-upable is probably your best bet
2018-03-06 11:30:05	koro	harrynoob: but blow-up is a very standard word for this, so I should stick with it
2018-03-06 11:30:25	harrynoob	yeah i'd just stick with blow-upable then
2018-03-06 11:30:28	koro	oh so it's not out of the question to use blow-upable?
2018-03-06 11:30:33	koro	fine
2018-03-06 11:30:40	koro	thanks
2018-03-06 11:30:41	unyu	dalcde: You've seen the stupid questions I've asked here. My degree of mathematical maturity is exactly that of an undergraduate.
2018-03-06 11:30:55	harrynoob	i mean it looks bad, and is probably bad english, but it's what you'd say in real life
2018-03-06 11:30:57	koro	unyu: no it isn't
2018-03-06 11:31:51	dalcde	unyu: I'm not sure how that is relevant to the current discussion.
2018-03-06 11:31:59	Galois	I only care about blowups to resolve singularities, so I would say resolvable
2018-03-06 11:32:20	koro	doesn't work for me. these are fixed points of a map. resolving means nothing
2018-03-06 11:32:28	koro	but i'll go with blow-upable
2018-03-06 11:32:35	math833	blow-jobable?
2018-03-06 11:32:44	harrynoob	what kind of obstructions would there be to blowing up in this context
2018-03-06 11:32:55	harrynoob	ie why do you even need an adjective for this
2018-03-06 11:33:23	math833	I will laugh if they get recommendations back saying dont use blow-upable
2018-03-06 11:34:06	koro	you want to replace the fixed point p by a circle, say, i.e. if X is your space you consider X\{p} \cup circle, with an adequate topology. You want the map f to extend continuously to this circle
2018-03-06 11:34:10	koro	this is not always doable
2018-03-06 11:34:24	koro	it is for instance if X is nice and f is differentiable, but not in general
2018-03-06 11:34:36	harrynoob	ah, i see, yes
2018-03-06 11:35:18	koro	i suppose i should say sphere, or whatever instead of circle. In my case X = surface so circle is the right thing
2018-03-06 11:48:23	yashi	What is the Laplace transform of a time-ordered exponential?
2018-03-06 11:51:06	asdfffd	hi, is it true that if f is continous and (xn) is Cauchy sequence, then (f(xn)) is also caucy sequence
2018-03-06 11:51:07	asdfffd	?
2018-03-06 11:51:20	asdfffd	I know it it is true if f is uniformly continous
2018-03-06 11:51:36	asdfffd	but  I am not sure if f is only continous
2018-03-06 11:52:07	pedro3005	it's not true
2018-03-06 11:52:28	pedro3005	f(x) = 1/x and x_n = 1/n
2018-03-06 11:54:20	asdfffd	right, (f(xn)) = n is not cauchy ,thans
2018-03-06 11:54:27	yashi	It's not a coincidence that in Hebrew Cauchy means "difficulty".
