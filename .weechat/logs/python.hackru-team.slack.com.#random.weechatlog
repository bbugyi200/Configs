2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2018-01-23 22:30:57	anjali-modi	Hey guys hackhers are looking for mentors to lead workshops for beginners in different categories. It would be awesome if we can get more mentors :)  https://goo.gl/forms/EeVdownmloYVrZBL2
2018-01-23 22:30:57		HackHERS Workshop Mentor Application
2018-01-23 22:30:57		In the weeks leading up to HackHERS, we are aiming to conduct one to two workshops a week (2 hours long if once a week, 1 hour long each if twice a week) aimed at participants who have little to no knowledge on the skills required at a hackathon. Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4] 
2018-01-24 20:26:05	srihari.shankar1	I don’t mind giving a workshop

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2018-01-23 22:30:57	anjali-modi	Hey guys hackhers are looking for mentors to lead workshops for beginners in different categories. It would be awesome if we can get more mentors :)  https://goo.gl/forms/EeVdownmloYVrZBL2
2018-01-23 22:30:57		HackHERS Workshop Mentor Application
2018-01-23 22:30:57		In the weeks leading up to HackHERS, we are aiming to conduct one to two workshops a week (2 hours long if once a week, 1 hour long each if twice a week) aimed at participants who have little to no knowledge on the skills required at a hackathon. Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4]

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2018-01-23 22:30:57		In the weeks leading up to HackHERS, we are aiming to conduct one to two workshops a week (2 hours long if once a week, 1 hour long each if twice a week) aimed at participants who have little to no knowledge on the skills required at a hackathon. Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4]

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-23 20:22:24	jamie	i haven't seen it offered since spring 2015- pretty easy A  (edited)
2017-10-23 23:55:24	anjali-modi	human ecology was pretty easy :slightly_smiling_face: 
2017-10-24 10:30:14	srihari.shankar1	Take OS 
2017-10-24 14:02:56	mihai_andrei	^^^ 
2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-24 14:02:56	mihai_andrei	^^^ 
2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-24 14:02:56	mihai_andrei	^^^ 
2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2018-01-23 22:30:57	anjali-modi	Hey guys hackhers are looking for mentors to lead workshops for beginners in different categories. It would be awesome if we can get more mentors :)  https://goo.gl/forms/EeVdownmloYVrZBL2
2018-01-23 22:30:57		HackHERS Workshop Mentor Application
2018-01-23 22:30:57		In the weeks leading up to HackHERS, we are aiming to conduct one to two workshops a week (2 hours long if once a week, 1 hour long each if twice a week) aimed at participants who have little to no knowledge on the skills required at a hackathon. Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4] 
2018-01-24 20:26:05	srihari.shankar1	I don’t mind giving a workshop

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2018-01-23 22:30:57	anjali-modi	Hey guys hackhers are looking for mentors to lead workshops for beginners in different categories. It would be awesome if we can get more mentors :)  https://goo.gl/forms/EeVdownmloYVrZBL2
2018-01-23 22:30:57		HackHERS Workshop Mentor Application
2018-01-23 22:30:57		In the weeks leading up to HackHERS, we are aiming to conduct one to two workshops a week (2 hours long if once a week, 1 hour long each if twice a week) aimed at participants who have little to no knowledge on the skills required at a hackathon. Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4]

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4]

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-23 20:22:24	jamie	i haven't seen it offered since spring 2015- pretty easy A  (edited)
2017-10-23 23:55:24	anjali-modi	human ecology was pretty easy :slightly_smiling_face: 
2017-10-24 10:30:14	srihari.shankar1	Take OS 
2017-10-24 14:02:56	mihai_andrei	^^^ 
2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-24 14:02:56	mihai_andrei	^^^ 
2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2018-01-23 22:30:57	anjali-modi	Hey guys hackhers are looking for mentors to lead workshops for beginners in different categories. It would be awesome if we can get more mentors :)  https://goo.gl/forms/EeVdownmloYVrZBL2
2018-01-23 22:30:57		HackHERS Workshop Mentor Application
2018-01-23 22:30:57		In the weeks leading up to HackHERS, we are aiming to conduct one to two workshops a week (2 hours long if once a week, 1 hour long each if twice a week) aimed at participants who have little to no knowledge on the skills required at a hackathon. Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4]

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2018-01-23 22:30:57		HackHERS Workshop Mentor Application
2018-01-23 22:30:57		In the weeks leading up to HackHERS, we are aiming to conduct one to two workshops a week (2 hours long if once a week, 1 hour long each if twice a week) aimed at participants who have little to no knowledge on the skills required at a hackathon. Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4]

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2018-01-23 22:30:57		In the weeks leading up to HackHERS, we are aiming to conduct one to two workshops a week (2 hours long if once a week, 1 hour long each if twice a week) aimed at participants who have little to no knowledge on the skills required at a hackathon. Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4]

2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-23 20:14:25	jamie	does anyone have any class recommendations? i need more credits .-. 
2017-10-23 20:14:46	jamie	preferably something fun/will learn something 
2017-10-23 20:15:01	Kabir	Highly recommend comp arch with franny  [:joy:4] 
2017-10-23 20:15:32	jamie	10/10 
2017-10-23 20:16:59	ryanshah	I heard this class called orgo is fun and easy  [:100:3 :+1:2 :aussieparrot:1] 
2017-10-23 20:20:00	jamie	:cry: 
2017-10-23 20:21:07	jamie	i'm being bamboolzed by course schedule planner. there's 3 sections listed when picking through classes, but only 1 section listed when i select sections 
2017-10-23 20:22:09	jamie	also 10/10 would recommend 01:730:253   HUMAN NATURE & DIVER to people 
2017-10-23 20:22:24	jamie	i haven't seen it offered since spring 2015- pretty easy A  (edited)
2017-10-23 23:55:24	anjali-modi	human ecology was pretty easy :slightly_smiling_face: 
2017-10-24 10:30:14	srihari.shankar1	Take OS 
2017-10-24 14:02:56	mihai_andrei	^^^ 
2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-24 14:02:56	mihai_andrei	^^^ 
2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-24 14:02:56	mihai_andrei	^^^ 
2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2018-01-23 22:30:57		HackHERS Workshop Mentor Application
2018-01-23 22:30:57		In the weeks leading up to HackHERS, we are aiming to conduct one to two workshops a week (2 hours long if once a week, 1 hour long each if twice a week) aimed at participants who have little to no knowledge on the skills required at a hackathon. Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4] 
2018-01-24 20:26:05	srihari.shankar1	I don’t mind giving a workshop

2017-10-24 14:02:56	mihai_andrei	^^^ 
2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2018-01-23 22:30:57	anjali-modi	Hey guys hackhers are looking for mentors to lead workshops for beginners in different categories. It would be awesome if we can get more mentors :)  https://goo.gl/forms/EeVdownmloYVrZBL2
2018-01-23 22:30:57		HackHERS Workshop Mentor Application
2018-01-23 22:30:57		In the weeks leading up to HackHERS, we are aiming to conduct one to two workshops a week (2 hours long if once a week, 1 hour long each if twice a week) aimed at participants who have little to no knowledge on the skills required at a hackathon. Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4]

2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2018-01-23 22:30:57		In the weeks leading up to HackHERS, we are aiming to conduct one to two workshops a week (2 hours long if once a week, 1 hour long each if twice a week) aimed at participants who have little to no knowledge on the skills required at a hackathon. Topics that we'd like to have covered are HTML, Java, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Please fill out the following application if you are interested in leading one of these workshops. [:+1:4]

2017-10-24 14:02:56	mihai_andrei	^^^ 
2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.

2017-10-23 20:14:25	jamie	does anyone have any class recommendations? i need more credits .-. 
2017-10-23 20:14:46	jamie	preferably something fun/will learn something 
2017-10-23 20:15:01	Kabir	Highly recommend comp arch with franny  [:joy:4] 
2017-10-23 20:15:32	jamie	10/10 
2017-10-23 20:16:59	ryanshah	I heard this class called orgo is fun and easy  [:100:3 :+1:2 :aussieparrot:1] 
2017-10-23 20:20:00	jamie	:cry: 
2017-10-23 20:21:07	jamie	i'm being bamboolzed by course schedule planner. there's 3 sections listed when picking through classes, but only 1 section listed when i select sections 
2017-10-23 20:22:09	jamie	also 10/10 would recommend 01:730:253   HUMAN NATURE & DIVER to people 
2017-10-23 20:22:24	jamie	i haven't seen it offered since spring 2015- pretty easy A  (edited)
2017-10-23 23:55:24	anjali-modi	human ecology was pretty easy :slightly_smiling_face: 
2017-10-24 10:30:14	srihari.shankar1	Take OS 
2017-10-24 14:02:56	mihai_andrei	^^^ 
2017-10-25 00:23:26	ross	take math 356, number theory 
2017-10-25 00:24:19	ross	if you can write a proof and pay attention it’s a super easy class, especially if you like numbers the way most CS people should 
2017-10-25 00:25:13	ross	tho i don’t know who’s teaching it… 
2017-10-25 00:26:35	ross	not a cs elective tho 
2017-10-25 00:39:48	ross	if you want a super solid math class that is a cs elective, the only one I know to recommend is Math 461, which is also a hecking good class, it doesn’t list who’s teaching it but it’s probably Prof Thomas who is fantastic albeit not non-math minded friendly. He gives A+ shit talks sometimes too, probably slightly fewer than Farach if that’s a helpful metric.
