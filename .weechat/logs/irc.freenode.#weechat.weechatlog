2018-03-04 01:40:45	bbugyi200	Hey guys. I use the alt key as my main modifier key for my xmonad configuration. Is there anyway to change the `meta` key used for WeeChat? Alternatively, is there any way to change the binding for the Alt-k command?

2018-03-04 01:51:13	@FlashCode	bbugyi200: you can not change the Alt key in weechat, you should better use another key like the Win key in your window manager (as many applications are using the Alt key)
2018-03-04 01:51:30	@FlashCode	and yes you can rebind any key in weechat
2018-03-04 01:51:57	@FlashCode	for example to rebind alt-k on alt-q: /key bind meta-q /input grab_key_command
2018-03-04 01:53:01	bbugyi200	Awesome. Thanks. I'll try that.

2018-03-04 08:35:15	squirrel	i'm not sure how gpg works, is "11E9DE8848F2B65222AA75B8D1820DB22A11534E" the only thing needed to verify the package?
2018-03-04 08:35:28	grawity	indirectly, but yes

2018-03-04 08:51:25	grawity	so either way it'd be most reliable to use either the HKPS pool (standard port 443), or the p80 pool
2018-03-04 08:51:48	grawity	well, p80 is most reliable, hkps pool can have problems if the network blocks DNS SRV records

2018-03-04 09:33:35	Techman	<@nils_2> Techman: not every problem can be solved with a /trigger, sometimes a /script is better.
2018-03-04 09:33:46	Techman	Something is wrong with the script though
2018-03-04 09:34:09	Techman	It broke somewhere and everyone's nick started with F000... something like that
2018-03-04 09:34:26	Techman	And that was a mess that resulted in me deleting the script and restarting weechat
2018-03-04 09:34:50	@nils_2	then fix the script and there is no need to start weechat at any time
2018-03-04 09:35:25	Techman	I don't know what in the script breaks

2018-03-04 09:44:37	sylvblck	because of slash
2018-03-04 09:44:47	sylvblck	i would accept to escape it
2018-03-04 09:45:23	sylvblck	like: here is a path \/etc\/foo\/bar
2018-03-04 09:45:34	sylvblck	and it would print /etc/foo/bar

2018-03-04 09:48:58	sylvblck	so the answer is no i guess

2018-03-04 13:37:49	squigz	Not quite. That'll be handled by your terminal emulator.

2018-03-04 13:38:42	id4rk	been using weechat for some weeks now
2018-03-04 13:38:45	id4rk	very happy
2018-03-04 13:41:40	banzaikitten	hm what was that command to turn everything into like plain text
2018-03-04 13:41:53	squigz	meta-l /window bare
2018-03-04 13:42:00	banzaikitten	thanks
2018-03-04 13:42:01	squigz	alt+l by default
2018-03-04 13:42:27	boomboxnation	Oh my...that is awesome...did not know.
2018-03-04 13:44:00	boomboxnation	I've been hammering alt-m trying to copy messages.
2018-03-04 13:44:24	squigz	so cute
2018-03-04 13:44:46	wonko42	where to change meta key (alt) to another key binding? I'm using i3 - so alt is already in use
2018-03-04 13:44:50	boomboxnation	I'm not cute...outside my ignorance and lack of research.
2018-03-04 13:45:31	squigz	wonko42: You can't change the meta key to another key. You can change every keybind that uses meta, but...
2018-03-04 13:45:41	squigz	As for i3, you can easily switch the $mod key to the Super(Windows) key
2018-03-04 13:45:45	squigz	in fact, that's recommended
2018-03-04 13:45:52	squigz	A lot of applications use Alt as their own modifier key
2018-03-04 13:46:37	wonko42	OK ... I'll think about it. But I'm used to alt for i3 ...

2018-03-05 16:09:52	@FlashCode	if you change the color settings for nicks, then all nicks may have a new color (which will not change until you change settings again)

2018-03-06 19:01:51	Techman	Well, it looks like irssi has cap 3.2 now
2018-03-06 19:02:09	Techman	tfw the inferior cli client gets a leg up on weechat :o
2018-03-06 19:16:56	X-Jester	has anyone successfully regexp'd the irc_kick trigger? having trouble with tg_message_nocolor and substitution
2018-03-06 19:26:47	hjst	I'm setting up a relay, and connecting to it via IRC with a local weechat instance. It's all working fine except the timestamps in backlog replays when I connect. In the text for relay.irc.backlog_time_format it says "format for time in backlog messages (not used if server capability 'server-time' was enabled by client, because time is sent as irc tag)"
2018-03-06 19:27:55	hjst	I've got it set to the default H:M format, and when I connect with the local weechat instance I see the timestamps in the text of the messages, rather than seeing the adjusted "native" timestamps as I'd expect
2018-03-06 19:30:54	hjst	aaah, I see irc.server_default.capabilities is empty

2018-03-06 21:28:05	kevr`	is there a way to remove a script from the database? I fear that this script is just too old, and I don't really want to maintain it myself
2018-03-06 21:28:11	kevr`	(lnotify.py)
2018-03-06 21:28:32	squigz	I believe that's up to FlashCode

2018-03-07 16:46:02	rekishi	i looked through the colors portion of the config, how do I change the nick in the input line?
2018-03-07 16:48:28	nejni-marji	I started typing up an explanation of what I'm looking for, but I really think the only way to do it is to modify the remote relay client application I'm using and compile it.
